<P>In other news, <a href="http://aspnetweblog.com/">Scott Watermasysk</a> kindly offered to send me the source to his HTML editing control, pictured <a href="http://aspnetweblog.com/images/richeditor.gif">here</a>.  I'm scared of the legal implications of looking at others' source outside of MS.  He may still send me the binaries though and those are fair game.  One question Scott, where did you get the cool flat tab control?  It looks like the one VS.Net uses.
