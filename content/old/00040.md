<P>I'm busy getting my FTP support up and working.  Learning all of this new stuff is fun.  I'm working directly off of <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc959.html">RFC 959</a> and looking at the debug log stuff in SmartFTP.
<P>So far I can connect, log in, create a passive connection and list the root directory.  Once I have enough support to upload a file (real close now) I'll be set.  I probably have another hour or two to get that working.
<P>However, I'm going to be travelling back to Seattle the rest of this week so I won't be able to work on my little tool here.
