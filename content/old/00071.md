<p>While the work computer is installing the latest version of longhorn...
<ul><li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0399149864&itm=1">Pattern Recognition</a> by William Gibson.  Short review: Not nearly as good as nueromancer -- wait for the paperback.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0394555090&itm=1">Theodore Rex</a> by Edmund Morris.  This is the followup to <u>The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt</u>.  After reading both of them, I think that the early life of Roosevelt is more interesting and dynamic.  The detailed description of his years in the whitehouse was something of an anticlimax.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0374528497&itm=1">The Metaphsycisal Club</a> by Louis Menand.  I just started this and it is heavy going.  However, I like it so far.  It isn't as dynamic (yet) as either of the Roosevent biographies.  I'll summerize after I finish it.
<li>Music: <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=696998641228">Scarlet's Walk</a> by Tori Amos.  This is some of her best stuff since Little Earthquakes.  
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286499">Bend It Like Beckham</a>.  I saw this at the Idaho International Film Festival (Bet you didn't know that Idaho had a film festival) and I liked it a lot.  I thought it was clever with some hot women in it.  What's not to like?
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258068">The Quiet American</a>.  This 2002 remake of a 1958 film was very moving.  Starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, it details a love triangle set in pre-US involvement Vietnam in the 50s.  Brendan Fraser is so hit or miss -- remember Monkeybone?
<li>Play: <a href="http://www.arbiteronline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/03/20/3e7920b2a19a6">Icarus</a> written by Edwin Sanchez and directed by Brian Weaver.  I enjoyed the play a lot -- I haven't been to a play in a while.  I thought the ending was a little bit of a let down.  It was very open ended.
