    <p>
        I just feel sorry for <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/04/29/star_war.shtml">this</a> kid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, the story (23rd hand, probably) is this:&#160; This kid used a school camera
        to video tape his star wars fighting skills.&#160; He forgot to take the tape out
        and someone else found it.&#160; I've mirrored the original video <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Stuff/Star_Wars_Kid.wmv">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It wasn't long before somebody on the net remixed it by adding appropriate sounds
        and special effects.&#160; I've mirrored that <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Stuff/Star_Wars_Kid_Remix.wmv">here</a> also.
