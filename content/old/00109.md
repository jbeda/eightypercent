        I just don't get the excitement around 802.11a and 802.11g standards.&#160; Sure --
        5 times as fast would be nice, but in reality, I'm not using my wireless connection
        for anything that requires faster speeds.&#160; God knows my broadband connection
        can't keep up with 11Mbps.&#160; And if I do (like copying GBs of photos around) I
        just plug in to an ethernet cable. I know, eventually we'll get video on demand and
        all sorts of other high end services over these wireless links.

        802.11b strikes a great balance of speed and range.&#160; The build-out is happening.&#160;
        Why is the press trying to make such a big deal of it?&#160; Or is it not the press
        and there are people who are&#160;really excited about this stuff?

        (10Gb ethernet might be more interesting as this means the network is approaching
        bus speeds.)
