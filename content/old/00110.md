    <p>
        I got some email from someone who calls himself "RAD Moose" (blogs offline...) on
        an easier way to take a snapshot from a video file.&#160; This might come in handly
        later.&#160; Here it is: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Open WindowsMovieMaker2 (feature not in WMM1) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Import Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll thru movie in Preview Window 
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "Take Picture From Preview Window" item in Tools Menu 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Very cool!&#160; I'll have to download Movie Maker 2 and give this a try!
