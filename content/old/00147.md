    In an entry below I listed the wrong email address to get ahold of me!&#160; If you
    want to talk to me about pdc stuff send me email at <a href="mailto:pdc@bedafamily.com">pdc@<em>bedafamily.com</em></a>.&#160;
    I haven't bothered to figure out how to hook up forwarding for the eightypercent.net
    domain yet.
