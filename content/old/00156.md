    <p>
        If you are at all interested in photography, you might want to try out a workshop.&#160;
        I went on one to Death Valley last year with Steve Kossack.&#160; He knows the area
        like the back of his hand and runs a great workshop.&#160; You get up before dawn
        to shoot the sunrise, take it easy during the afternoon and then stay up past sunset.

        <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/workshops/sk-dv-03.shtml">Here</a>&#160;is
        a page describing the upcoming workshop March 4-8.&#160; I'm actually in the first
        picture on that page (second from the left).&#160; If you end up doing it, let Steve
        know I sent you!
