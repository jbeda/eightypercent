        Chris -- Thanks for the <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/c8dae103-c610-4829-bc2d-d9fcb32be084">comments</a> on
        my theater plans.&#160; I really want to come over and see your setup as long as you
        promise me I won't drown.

        Chris mentioned Paradigms.&#160; I have a set of Paradigm Reference Studio/40 v2 and
        I love them.&#160; I don't want to take those and repurpose them from my living room
        to my theater so I'm starting over from that respect.&#160; Getting a full HT setup
        with the Studio line is probably more than I want to spend.&#160; However, I've been
        reading good things about the Monitor series.&#160; If I can get a good price on them
        from north of the border, I'll probably do that.&#160; (I was thinking B&amp;W too,
        but I like the sound of my Studio/40s.)

        With respect to the Infocus ScreenPlay 4800, that projector is just the Infocus X1
        repackaged for the home theater retail channel.&#160; It costs a good $300 more for
        essentially the same projector.&#160; I think that I'm going to up the ante a little
        bit and I now have a <a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/Sanyo-PLV-Z2.htm">Sanyo</a> <a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/sanyo_plv_z2.htm">Z2</a> on
        order.&#160; This is a much higher resolution (720p native) 16:9 LCD projector.&#160;
        It costs more, but I think that the resolution is going to be worth it.&#160; Supposedly
        the latest round of LCD projectors have the contrast ratio that the DLPs are famous
        for.&#160; Beyond this the Z2 has a DVI input.

        I couldn't get the deal on the Yamaha RXV1400 that I thought I could (even though
        I love the idea of a feedback based autocalibration feature) so I'm thinking the Denon
        3803 now.&#160; My current 2ch reciever is a Denon and I'm pretty happy with that.&#160;
        I'll see if I can get a good deal on the 3803.

        Beyond that, I'm going to paint the wall or go with&#160;painted fiber board to begin
        with and then look at buying a screen.&#160; I'm not sure what size I want yet!&#160;
        (6.25ftx3.5ft sounds good to start with.)

        Doing this whole home theater thing is a blast!&#160; There is so much to learn and
        read.&#160; There are tons of good forums and review sites.&#160; The process of just
        figuring out what I'm going to get is a huge undertaking in and of itself.
