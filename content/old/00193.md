        It's (a)live!&#160; Look <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9C1724D1-B63E-4D7D-835A-FF94A1FAD311&amp;displaylang=en">here</a> (up
        on ms.com) for the 3D Graph demo that shows off the 3D demo from WinHEC that I <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/06.html#a182">talked
        about quite a while ago</a>.&#160; Here it is again:

        I apologize that this took so long to get out here.&#160; I've been busy and it has
        been interesting to get this hosted on MS.com.&#160; I have some other similar samples
        coming and I think that I'll just host them here directly.&#160; I mostly took the
        demo code that Nathan and Robert had and cleaned it up for public consumption.

        Take a look at it and let me know what you think.&#160; As Avalon moves forward, I'd
        like to keep this example up to date and add to it.

        If you are interested in Avalon 3D and you haven't found his site yet, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/">DanLehen</a> has
        some great samples up and running.
