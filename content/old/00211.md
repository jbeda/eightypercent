        I met with HR yesterday afternoon to turn in my batch and my corporate AmEx card.&#160;
        It felt like a cheesy cop show:&#160; "Gimme your badge and your gun, Mahoney -- you're
        suspended!"&#160; Right after that I went back to my building and had a buddy sign
        me in as a visitor so that we could all hang out and play some xbox.&#160; It&#160;was
        hard to let go and not get involved in the discussions going on in the hallways.&#160;
        The day before a large group of us went out for my goodbye lunch.&#160; It felt a
        little bit like a funeral in its finality.&#160;

        First off, I'd like to say that everyone has been really good about my leaving --
        both inside and outside of the company.&#160; I think that most everyone understands
        that 7 years is a long time and that I've "done my time."&#160; Thanks for all of
        the Congrats!

        There are a set of reaction posts and comments that are interesting.&#160; <a href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/akinney/archive/2004/09/02/5125.aspx">Adam
        Kinney</a> was first off the line. <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/627ef915-1661-4906-ae07-a99e02cd83ae">ChrisAn</a> also
        had some nice stuff to say.&#160; I got contacted by a reporter from CNet looking
        for a story.&#160; There really is no big story, but she ended up writing a <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-1032-5347491.html">short
        blurb</a> in "news.blog."&#160;

        Looking at macro trends, check out the comments to <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=5192cf7a-fe03-47b7-953f-72d61abace97">Dare's
        post</a>.&#160; My buddy Vince at articulatebabble.com (who I broke the news to a
        day or two before) had some comments on <a href="http://www.articulatebabble.org/archives/2004/09/02T085804.php">Microsoft
        and Google</a>.&#160; Finally, over at "Mini-Microsoft", Who da'Punk <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2004/09/dangerous-transitions.html">fits
        my leaving</a> into his smaller is better paradigm.&#160; I think that he and Vince
        both have some really solid points.&#160; Microsoft could do with some focusing.

        My plan this weekend was to get a very tall (30 foot) ladder and clean my gutters.&#160;
        But since my health insurance is in a little bit of a state of limbo before I start
        at Google on Tuesday, my wife won't let me do that.&#160;
