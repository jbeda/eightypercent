    <p>
        Taking a break from inadvertently feeding the rumor mill, I'd like to point to the
        announcement for the new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0409/04092104canoneos1dsmkii.asp">Canon
        1Ds Mark II</a>.&#160; This thing looks awesome!&#160; Features that stand out: 16.7
        MP full frame, fast startup time and a wireless transfer option.&#160; There is still
        a question if they improved the battery technology or not.&#160; Not bad for a&#160;mere
        $8k.&#160; The thing still looks super big and heavy.

        I would love to own one of these, but I can't see my self spending that much on what
        is really a hobby.&#160; Plus, in the spirit of sour grapes, it would probably be
        too heavy.&#160; I really can't complain because I just received&#160;the Canon 20D
        that I preordered a little while ago.&#160; Now I have to find the time to go out
        and shoot.
