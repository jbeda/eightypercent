    <p>
        I'm watching the "Making of" for <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ia/0,1976,FOOD_16696,00.html">Iron
        Chef America</a> right now.&#160; I'm super excited.&#160; From what I've seen it
        looks like they've done a really good translation for the US market.&#160; I'm planning
        on watching the marathon tonight.&#160; I watched the William Shatner special a while
        ago and wasn't all that impressed.&#160; Hopefully this one will be better.

        The real clincher for me is <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com">Alton Brown</a>.&#160;
        He does the play by play and is the guy doing most of the talking. I've been a huge
        fan of Alton for quite a while.&#160; He is the guy behind Good Eats on the food network.&#160;
        He is really the thinking person's TV chef.
