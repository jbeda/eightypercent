    <p>
        Today is a travel day for me, but I wanted to log in from the airport to post about
        the release of the Jingle specs.

        We've been working with the Jabber community to&#160;standardize the P2P protocols
        that we've built on top of XMPP/Jabber.&#160; This process has already been super
        useful in thinking through new scenarios.&#160;&#160; I look forward to continued
        collaboration between Google and the Jabber community.&#160; More links on this: Peter

        The current protocols are still a work in progress so stay tuned for more developments.
