    <p>
        If you haven't heard yet, we shipped a new version of the Google Talk client to a
        small set of testers yesterday.&#160; You can get a review over at <a href="http://www.customizetalk.com/">customizetalk.com</a>.&#160;
        Hopefully we'll fix any outstanding issues and get this version out to everyone soon.

        I wasn't super involved in this version but did manage to sneak a couple of features
        in.&#160; The first was Friend Online notifications (defaults to off to avoid annoying
        people). I also did the new hover cards for your Friends.&#160; I wanted people to
        be able to see all of the cool pictures in&#160;true 96x96 pixel alpha blended glory.

        We hope you like it!&#160; Let us know what features are important to you by filling
        out our <a href="https://services.google.com/inquiry/talk_suggest">suggestion form</a>.
