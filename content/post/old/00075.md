<p>I was playing around with SharpReader and apparently I hit their server one too many times, as I'm now <a href="http://slashdot.org/faq/accounts.shtml#ac1050">banned</a> from the slashdot RSS feed.  Too funny -- I think I'll live.
<p>You can get banned from the front page too.  I've seen it happen at work when they mistook our proxy servers for someone hammering their machines.  They display a big red page.
