    <p>
        I've released a new version of JoeBlogger based on feedback from <a href="http://www.neelbubba.com">Bubba</a> and <a href="http://devhawk.net/">Harry</a>.&#160;
        I've also fixed a few problems that I've found.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-0.9.1.msi">msi</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-src-0.9.1.zip">src</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/Readme-0.9.1.txt">readme</a> and <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/License.txt">license</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed data loss issues when hitting "New Entry" button while current entry hasn't
            been uploaded.</li>
        <li>
            Fixed FTP issues with multi-line responses from FTP server.</li>
        <li>
            Added a "FilePutDelay" parameter to the site1.config file for dealing with FTP servers
            that get confused if you move too fast.&#160; This is in milliseconds.&#160; 1000
            seems to solve most problems.</li>
        <li>
            Moved some code around and had to put a custom binder in the upstreamer deserialization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There aren't any big new features yet.&#160; I just haven't had time.&#160; However,
        when the new system goes up at gotdotnet.com, I'll probably start a workspace over
        there.&#160; I haven't done it already because the current source control system that
        comes with the workspaces is really really bad.

        Oh, and since pretty pictures make everything go down smoother, here is a screenshot:
