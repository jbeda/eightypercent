    <p>
        Just wondering, but does anyone know if Mac OS X actually allows processes to run
        with a full 64 bit address space?&#160; Or is everything just running in a 32 bit
        compat mode?&#160; I couldn't see anything with a quick search on Apple's web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        WinNT ran on the 64 bit alpha quite a while ago, but it only ran in a 32 bit mode.&#160;
        Is Apple doing the same thing here?&#160; Is the whole 64 bit thing, wrt Apple, all
        flash and no fire?
    </p>

        BTW, just because the&#160;new&#160;G5 machines&#160;can have 8GB of RAM doesn't mean
        that an <em>individual</em> process can access more than 4GB.&#160; Hell,&#160;some
        Intel procs&#160;can access &gt;4Gb, but they are still 32 bit processors.&#160; For
        example, the 32 bit version of W2k3 server can support 32GB of RAM.&#160; This extra
        RAM can be accessed via specialized APIs or you can have, for example, 10 processes
        each using 2GB.
