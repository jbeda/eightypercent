        Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/23.html#a3879">linked to
        me</a>.&#160; Thanks dude!

        However, I'm not a PM.&#160; I'm a Dev Lead.&#160; I don't know if everyone knows
        the break down of different jobs at Microsoft, but, in the technical areas, there
        are three main jobs: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/programmanagement.aspx">Program
        Management</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaredevelopment.aspx">Development</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaretesting.aspx">Test</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The breakdown goes like this:&#160; PMs talk to customers, develop requirements and
        write specs, Devs implement the code to those specs and Test validates that the Devs
        did their job.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, things never work out that cleanly.&#160; For example, the Test team are
        some of the people first using the product so they may have more and better feedback
        than just if the program works.&#160; And in a techinical area, like what I'm working
        on (graphics and APIs), a lot of the design work can be done by devs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft is trying to develop higher level individual contributer developers to help
        lead the architecture of the product.&#160; I'm heading down that track right now.&#160; <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> is
        another example of this.&#160; Part of this is that just because you are good at writing
        code doesn't mean that you are good at managing people.&#160; Beyond that, it is <em>really</em> hard
        to find PMs that can operate at the technical level necessary for some groups -- such
        as designing windows APIs.&#160; As a result of this, higher level individual contributer
        devs and technical PMs do many of the same jobs.&#160; This is why I've spent that
        last year or so writing specs!
