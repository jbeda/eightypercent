    <p>
        I really have to write some software for doing picture galleries so that I can put
        up a bunch of stuff from my trip.&#160; In the meantime, <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3989380&amp;page=1">here</a>&#160;are <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3990064&amp;page=1">some</a> links&#160;to
        a thread I started over on the roadfly forum about the new ride.&#160; There are some
        pictures from the trip up there.
