    <p>
        This afternoon I went to some meetings on how to present yourself as a Microsoft employee
        for the PDC.&#160; It was mostly predictable -- use common sense when talking to customers,
        don't badmouth competitors and be careful around the press.&#160; However, one thing
        that stuck out in my mind is the fact that we are now encouranged to hand out our
        business cards.&#160; In the past, it was considered a virtue to keep the development
        team from getting "distracted" by direction interaction with customers.&#160; I like
        this new approach a lot more.
