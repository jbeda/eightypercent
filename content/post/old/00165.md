    <p>
        I haven't been posting in a while as I've been working on my new Home Theater!
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the final setup:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/Sanyo-PLV-Z2.htm">Sanyo Z2</a> LCD projector.&#160;
            1280x720 widescreen.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.paradigm.com/Website/SiteParadigmProduct/ParadigmModels/MonSeriesII/Monseries.html">Paradigm
            Monitor</a> speakers.&#160; I got Monitor 7s in front with the CC-370 center and the
            ADP-370 dipole surrounds.&#160; I picked these up in Canada on Chris' recommendation.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.svsubwoofers.com/subs_pci_20-39.htm">SVS 20-39PC<em>i</em></a> subwoofer.&#160;
            This thing is a beast!&#160; It is over 3 feet high and can really shake the walls.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.usa.denon.com/catalog/products.asp?l=1&amp;c=2">Denon AVR-3803</a> reciever.&#160;
            There was a great deal going on these.&#160; Otherwise it would have been way out
            of my price range.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/shop/_templates/item_mainRTV.asp?model=231&amp;cat=52">ReplayTV
            5504</a> as a TV tuner.&#160; I got one of these as it was priced wrong at Circuit
            City.&#160; Normally it is ~$450 with 3 years of service, but they were selling them
            for $150 with 3 years of service as they had updated the pricing for no included service
            but the units they still had <em>did</em> have the free service.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/default.htm?culture=0">XBox</a>.&#160; Some games
            (like Amped 2) do 720p natively.&#160; They look pretty sweet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I also built my own ceiling mount for the projector and had a friend help me build
        and paint a screen.&#160; I'll put some pictures up when things get further along.
    </p>
