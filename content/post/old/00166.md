    <p>
        I don't know how many people care, but I'm sorry that I haven't been posting lately!&#160;
        I'll try to make that up some.&#160; Anyway, here is an update of what has been happening: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Went to Cabo San Lucas for a week and relaxed.&#160; It was great to sit in the sun
            at the beach, order a bucket of beers and eat tacos. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Adopted two dogs.&#160; Their names are Lady and Cocoa.&#160; Lady is one and a half
            years old and was rescued from a meth lab and was probably abused.&#160; She hasn't
            shown many signs of it, but you never know what is going to trigger memories of abuse.&#160;
            She had a litter of puppies when she was really young.&#160; Cocoa is the one puppy
            for which the rescuers didn't find a home.&#160; He was her favorite puppy, so we
            adopted them as a pair.&#160; More details and pictures to come later. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I celebrated the one year anniversary of my blog by not posting.&#160; You can find
            the first post <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/01/09.html">here</a> from
            Janurary 9, 2003. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Read lots and lots of books.&#160; I've been reading ebooks on my PocketPC on the
            bus to and from work every day.&#160; I love ebooks! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Started writing some ASP.Net code for a picture gallery over at bedafamily.com.&#160;
            I'd love to finish this up so that I can easily post lots of photos.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I've started recovering from the hibernation that is winter in Seattle.&#160; I want
        to start talking more about what is going on in Avalon and life in general.
