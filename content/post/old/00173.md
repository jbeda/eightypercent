        Never underestimate the throughput of a pigeon.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        While in New Zealand, we went on a caving trip that included a 100 meter abseil (rappel)
        into a cave and then climbed back out.&#160;&#160;One of&#160;the tour guides&#160;had
        a digital camera in a waterproof housing anchored to his harness.&#160; He took some
        pictures of us on the way down and when we got to the bottom.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The tour operator (<a href="http://www.waitomo.co.nz/">Waitomo Adventures</a>) wanted
        pictures from the adventrue to be ready by the time that we returned so that we could
        buy them.&#160; To do this they took&#160;the sony memory stick out of the camera
        and put in in to a little backpack on&#160;a carrier pigeon.&#160; They then let the
        pigeon go and yelled instructions to it on how to get back to the tour office.&#160;
        I think that the pigeon already knew the way, though.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we got back (a 20-25 minute trip in a van) the pigeon had arrived and the staff
        back at the office were busy printing out our pictures.

        We bought the pictures on CD also, but I don't have those with me right now.&#160;
        I'll post those soon so you can see the fruit of the little pigeon's labor.
