        <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/">Dan</a> has started a blog where he will
        be talking Avalon 3D.&#160; He is one of the devs that is currently working on this
        part of Avalon.&#160; Even though the Avalon 3D stuff is still early (we aren't feature
        complete yet) he plans on talking through what you <em>can</em> do with the WinHEC
        build.
