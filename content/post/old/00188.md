        <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/digital-panoramas.shtml">My article</a> on
        doing digital panoramas using PTAssembler and PanoTools is now up at the <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com">Luminous
        Landscape</a> photography site.&#160; If you haven't seen it before, this site is
        a wonderful resource for anyone interested in serious photography.&#160; I'd like
        to thank Michael Reichmann, the proprietor, for giving me a chance to contribute.

        As an intersting aside, the Idaho State Capitol building photo (from <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/04/08.html">here</a>)
        is an example of what happens if you don't set the reference image and point correctly.&#160;
        This is very similar to using a large amount of horizontal shift to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions on the article, let me know and I'll try to answer them
        here.&#160; There are a ton of resources out there on doing this stuff, so my main
        advice is to just jump in and give it a try.
