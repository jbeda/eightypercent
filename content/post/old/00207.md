    <p>
        I've polished up my pano building tool so that it now works with large 16 bit panoramas.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        To recap from <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/25.html">last
        episode</a>:&#160; <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm">PTAssembler</a> and <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/pano12ml.htm">PanoTools</a> are <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/digital-panoramas.shtml">really
        cool</a>&#160;but there are some bugs in PanoTools that prevent it from working with
        really large images or 16 bit images.&#160; The first is that PanoTools outputs tiff
        images that use packbits compression.&#160; For some reason Photoshop chokes when
        loading these files.&#160; The second issue is that PanoTools doesn't know how to
        create 16 bit photoshop files with layers as photoshop didn't <em>do</em> 16 bit layers
        when it was written.&#160; I've worked around this with my latest version of PanoTiffToPSD. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It does the following: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Optionally uses libtiff to reencode a set of tiff&#160;images with no compression.&#160;
            To save disk space, you can choose to overwrite the original images or do the conversion
            and leave the original images alone.&#160; The converted version will be deleted after
            being used by photoshop. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Loads up&#160;each of the tiff files and drives Photoshop (via IDispatch COM interfaces
            for you dorks out there) to load up each file and move it to a layer in a new image. 
        </li>
    </ol>
