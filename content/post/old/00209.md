        Rachel and I went to a reading from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312324839/qid=1094054140/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-5121671-1377764?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">"On
        Call: A Doctor's Days and Nights in Residency" by Emily Transue</a> last night.&#160;
        Emily is a friend of ours and was my wife Rachel's chief resident when she started
        residency.&#160; I haven't had a chance to read the book yet (we picked up a copy
        last night) but, from the excerpts that Emily read aloud, it sounds great.&#160; If
        you don't know someone who's been through residency (or even if you do!) this book
        will give you an understanding of the ups and downs -- both emotionally and physically
        -- that a doctor goes through during residency.&#160; I saw it up close and personal
        while Rachel was going through it.

        Trivia: That picture on the cover isn't her.&#160; But the coat is hers.&#160; She
        had to send it to New York for a couple of weeks to be photographed.&#160; She <em>does</em> have
        a picture on the inside of the sleeve.
