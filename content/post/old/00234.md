        A <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/25.html">while ago</a> I needed
        to do some stuff in Photoshop that wasn't easy to do from the interface.&#160; I decided
        to automate it from C#.
    </p>
    <p>
        John Deurbrouck just sent me a link to a page where he has decoded some more of the
        wacky photoshop ScriptListener output.&#160; He even has a routine to drive PS to
        convert a RAW image.

    <p>
        Check it out <a href="http://www.pcpix.com/Photoshop/">here</a>&#160;and contact John
        if you are interested in moving&#160;the knowledge in this area forward.&#160; 
    </p>

        Very cool, John!
