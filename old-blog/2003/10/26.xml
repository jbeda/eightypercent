      <Title>LA fires</Title>
      <Description>
    It is kind of sad that peoples &lt;a href="http://www.sbsun.com/Stories/0,1413,208%257E24658%257E1725112,00.html"&gt;homes&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="http://lang.sbsun.com/socal/gallery/?folder=news/102503_Waterman_fire"&gt;burning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;around
    LA and and I'm just thinking of my flight being canceled.&amp;#160; The house that my
    wife grew up in (and her dad built -- he is a contractor) probably burned in these
    fires.&amp;#160; It was on David Way in the foothills in San Bernardino and backed up
    to the Waterman Canyon.&amp;#160; Her family no longer owns it but it is sad to think
    that it is gone.</Description>

      <Title>Flight canceled</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Argh!&amp;#160; My flight has been canceled.&amp;#160; LAX is apparently a mess.&amp;#160; SriramS
        and I are hanging out in the bar near C8 in SEA so come by and say hi.&amp;#160; We are
        sitting in the back corner, both wearing blue shirts (differnt shades). We are supposedly
        booked on a flight out of here at 6 to Portland.&amp;#160; And then from there to LAX
        arriving after midnight. I've heard that Hillel Cooperman (who is giving our demo
        as part of the keynote) is in flight trouble also. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Here is a picture of me &lt;img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://www.eightypercent.net/Photos/JoePDCAirport.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /&gt;&amp;#160;and
        Sriram &lt;img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://www.eightypercent.net/Photos/SriramS.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        [Update: Kerry (whose hands you can see &lt;a href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/0509/kaigai01.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
        is&amp;#160;coming to join us!.&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/ffortes/"&gt;Fil&lt;/a&gt; probably
        will also after his flight is delayed.]&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        [Update 2: Now (9pm) in Portland scheduled to leave at midnight to arrive in the wee
        early hours!]
    &lt;/p&gt;
