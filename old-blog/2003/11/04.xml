      <Title>Avalon, XAML and SVG</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        There has been a ton of speculation on SVG and its relationship (or lack thereof)
        to Avalon.&amp;#160; Here is some thoughts on that, collected from various responses I've
        made or others have made. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Our rendering model is very much like that of SVG.&amp;#160; We support a hierarchical
            compositing model with transforms that affect items in the hiearchy. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Our markup isn't the same mostly because XAML is a direct reflection of the programming
            model.&amp;#160; There is a very solid relationship between the markup and the objects
            and methods. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Our OM doesn't match the SVG DOM because we choose to go with an object model that
            more closely matches what we think &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; users expect.&amp;#160; Specifically,
            we tried hard to make sure that our object model provided a certain amount of consistency
            with WinForms (and VB and MFC before it)&amp;#160;and ASP.Net.&amp;#160; Beyond this, our
            object model is strongly typed where much of the SVG DOM is based around strings.&amp;#160; 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            WVG is a term that we are no longer using and isn't, in my opinion, very useful.&amp;#160;
            We were supposed to have scrubbed this from our documentation, but apparently we missed
            some stuff.&amp;#160; There is no strick subset of Avalon objects and XAML markup that
            stands on its own with respect to vector graphics.&amp;#160; 
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    Whereas when using SVG inside of XHTML there is a very&amp;#160;bright line, when using
                    a vector graphic element in a UI authored in XAML, there is no sharp line.&amp;#160; You
                    can put a Rectangle element, for example, in flow with a document without a Canvas
                    element.&amp;#160; To do a similar thing with XHTML/SVG, you would need to wrap all SVG
                    content in an SVG element.&amp;#160; 
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    For Avalon, the set of properties and property types is the same between vector graphics
                    elements and other elements.&amp;#160; In this way the background property for a Button
                    is of type Brush -- the same as the fill property for a Rectangle. 
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    There are elements that can very easily be seen to belong to both a control subset
                    and a vector graphics subset.&amp;#160; For example, Image makes sense in a UI sense but
                    also in a VG sense.&amp;#160; XHTML and SVG both have image elements.&amp;#160; We avoid this
                    duplicity.&amp;#160; Text is another area where we avoid a large amount of duplication. 
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            While we share a rendering model with SVG to a large extent, our support and features
            don't match up completely.&amp;#160; Some of it is stuff that we haven't implemented yet
            and others are due to choices that we've made because of programming model concerns.&amp;#160;
            I'll try to put together a guide on this stuff at some point in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm sure there are questions around SVG and XAML/Avalon that I haven't answered here.&amp;#160;
        Post in the comments and I'll update this post with the latest and greatest.

      <Title>I hate Avalon</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Actually, I'm proud of the work that we are doing on Avalon, but I hate the name.&amp;#160;
        It just sounds lame and dorky to me.&amp;#160; I guess this is what you get when you vote
        on a code name.&amp;#160; Aero and Indigo are much better names.&amp;#160; In fact, the shell
        team has the best code names:&amp;#160;Aero, Jade, Luna, Plex.&amp;#160; I guess it is because
        they have designers who are creative types.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The worst code name I can think of right now was for NT4.&amp;#160; It started out being
        just and update to the shell.&amp;#160; So, it was called the "Shell Update Release" that
        got abbreviated SUR.&amp;#160; They even made T-Shirts that said "We don't need any stinkin'
        code name."
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Anyone haved examples of other really bad code names for projects?
    &lt;/p&gt;
