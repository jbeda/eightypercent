      <Title>DIY Home Theater Screen</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Somebody named Cash posted a comment asking about my DIY HT Screen.&amp;#160; Here is
        what I did: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Built a 2"x4" frame the size of my screen.&amp;#160; It is a simple rectangle with a supporting
            member in the middle.&amp;#160; I used some screws and metal "fasteners" to make all of
            the right angles. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            A friend came over and helped me mount it to the wall.&amp;#160; I did this by securing
            a 2"x4" in to studs in the wall.&amp;#160; I then put small blocks screwed to the back
            of my frame.&amp;#160; The small blocks were then set on top of the 2"x4" on the wall
            and shimmed until the frame was level on the wall.&amp;#160; I also put some blocks of
            wood in the bottom corners to support the bottom. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Once the frame was level and where I wanted it on the wall I screwed it in to the
            2"x4" that was already attached to the wall. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I then put a piece of hardboard (cut by Home Depot) on top of the frame.&amp;#160; This
            is essentially pegboard without the holes.&amp;#160; It is smooth enough and works pretty
            well.&amp;#160; I screwed this around the edges. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I then primed and painted the hardboard screen.&amp;#160; 2 coats of primer and 2 coats
            of matte "Misty Evening."&amp;#160; This is a color suggested by &lt;a href="http://avsforum.com"&gt;avsforum.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
            I used a small can of "Evermore Interior Latex Flat" paint.&amp;#160; The label has code
            "30BG 64/036" next to the Misty Evening name, if that helps.&amp;#160; This was all applied
            with a very fine roller and let dry. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I then built a mitered frame out of good quality (no warping) 1"x4"s.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;We
            wrapped these in black material&amp;#160; and stapled it on the back.&amp;#160; I used black
            felt, but I think that black velvet would be better if you can find a cheap source.&amp;#160;
            I then used finish nails to secure this around the edge of the screen and hide all
            of the screw heads.&amp;#160; I punched the nails in and they are now hidden&amp;#160;behind
            the fabric. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The result is probably overbuilt and not as great as a grayhawk screen, but the price
        can't be beat and it looks pretty darn professional.&amp;#160; The black border really
        helps. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Let me know if you have any questions or want any pictures!&amp;#160; I don't want to
        take it apart or anything :) 
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm back home and doing laundary and catching up on the Sopranos.&amp;#160; Here is another
        pano:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/NZ Pano7-med.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/NZ Pano7-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm going to try to get together a bunch of photos to get printed as &lt;a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com"&gt;West
        Coast Imaging&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;is having a &lt;a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com/wci/page/services/more/specials.htm"&gt;special&lt;/a&gt; on
        smaller prints that ends April 7th.&amp;#160; They have a cool printer that uses LEDs
        to light up regular old photo paper that is developed in traditional chemistry.&amp;#160;
        The whole thing is color profile savvy so you can be sure that you'll at least get
        within spitting distance of good color.&amp;#160; I've done prints with them before and
        been happy with the results. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
