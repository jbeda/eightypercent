      <Title>Sleeping through the night</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Last night was the first time Annie slept through the night.&amp;#160; We put her to bed
        around 8pm and it is now 6:20am and she is still asleep. We've been working over the
        past couple of nights to eliminate her&amp;#160;late night&amp;#160;feeding and help her to
        get back to sleep on her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I mentioned to my wife this morning I feel like we discovered the lost city of gold.&amp;#160;
        Even if it doesn't go like this every night it is good to know that it can be done.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Here is a recent picture of our little babe:
