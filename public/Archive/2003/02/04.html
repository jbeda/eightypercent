<P>I'm off to Boise.  All my stuff is packed up and the guinea pig is packaged up in her carrier.</P>
<P>I probably won't have time to post again (and work on my software!) until sometime this weekend.  The cable modem is supposed to be installed on Thursday.  We'll see</P>
<P>Wish me luck!</P>

<P>I meant to write this earlier but I got carried away working on JoeBlogger
<P>I'm moving to Boise for the next 5 months (back in July) to be with my wife.  She is a doctor and her residency takes her to Boise for a year.  She has already been out there since the beginning of July 2002, but it has been really hard being apart.
<P>I've worked it out with my management so that I can telecommute.  Everyone at MSFT has been super supportive about this.  I think that the whole thing is just amazing. I'm looking forward to being able to really crank on stuff without all of the interuptions of being at the office.
<P>Now all I have to do is avoid all of the "interuptions" at home

<P>This is a test of an entry generated in my tool.  I have to type in raw HTML right now, but everything appears to be working...</P>
<P>Here is a screen shot of the current UI:</P>
<IMG src="/Stuff/JoeBlogger2.JPG" >
<P>Things yet to do...</P>
<UL>
<LI> Use MSHTML for rich editing.  And switch back and forth in a reasonable way. (Does anyone out there have a simple example I can drop in here?  I'm not looking forward to screwing with all of the interop)
<LI>Automatic upstreaming
<LI>Allow changing of time on an entry
<LI>Deleting and other such management of an entry
<LI>Categories!
<LI>Work on my template to improve the look of my site
<LI>Multiple site management and site configuration.  A lot of stuff is hard coded right now.
</UL>
<P>I've also decided that storing the entries in an xml file per day is a bad idea.  The timezones will get you.  I store the timestamp on an entry using GMT but the XML file (which is used as input into the UI) is based on local time.  I also use localtime all over the place in the UI.  I'll probably move to a flat list of entries (one per XML file) at some point and just figure out the local day assignments at runtime.  This will map much better to a real database anyway.</P>
