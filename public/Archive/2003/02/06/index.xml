&lt;P&gt;I&#39;m moved in and have a cable modem set up.  I spent today buying all of that stuff you have to buy when you move. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But I think that I have everything that I need.  I should be working again tomorrow.  It was really amazing to me how fast everything went.  I moved out here, got a cable modem, bought and set up a wireless router, recieved my Cisco ATA for vonage and plugged everything in.  Everything worked flawlessly.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Oh, and it is nice to see my wife again too ;)  Time to go to bed.  I want to start getting up early so I can match Rachel&#39;s doctor schedule.&lt;/P&gt;
