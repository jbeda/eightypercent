Okay, Chris, what &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; you want in the FTP upstreamer?  I don&#39;t think that Radio&#39;s upstreamer deletes either.  Here is what I can do easily:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD to a directory.  Throw if the dir isn&#39;t there.
&lt;li&gt;[done] Ensure a directory.  Try my best to make sure that a directory (and the path up to it) exists.
&lt;li&gt;Delete a directory.  The server will probably return an error if there are files in it.  I will throw.
&lt;li&gt;Get the current directory.
&lt;li&gt;Move up a direcotry.
&lt;li&gt;[done] Upload a file into the current directory.
&lt;li&gt;Download a file in the current directory and return a stream.  It would be easiest to buffer the entire file in memory.
&lt;li&gt;Delete a file in the current directory.
&lt;li&gt;[done] Return a text string with the current directory listing.
&lt;li&gt;Call SYST and return whatever the system gives us.  This might help detect the type of system on the other end.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that isn&#39;t easy and that will probably take quite a while to get right is parsing the output of the directory listing.  I don&#39;t have a bunch of servers to test this against to make sure it will work.
&lt;p&gt;As for the upstreamer itself, I&#39;d rather have it not try and sync the stuff on the server (and hence delete stuff) because I&#39;d be afraid of loosing data.  For instance, I upstream into the root of my site and I have all sorts of subdirs off of that.  I&#39;m setting up a weblog for Rachel on eightypercent.net and her root will be a subdir.  I don&#39;t want to clobber her stuff whenever I upload my site.
