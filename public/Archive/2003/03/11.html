<p>I've gotten some nibbles from at least 4 people on the upstreamer.  That isn't all 7 of you out there but I guess this will do :)
<p>I'll start on it this weekend or sometime early next week.  Hopefully it will go fast as I already have the FTP code.
<p><a href="http://gary.burd.info">Gary Burd</a> suggested a combo of ssh, rsync and a crontab entry. It looks like you can <a href="http://optics.ph.unimelb.edu.au/help/rsync/">install RSync on windows</a> if you try hard enough. However, I don't have that much control over all of the machines that I want to upload to, so this looks like a non-starter -- at least for me.  Getting a more secure connection would be nice, though.
<p>I also was thinking about taking advantage of the shadow copy stuff in XP but it looks like you need to sign an NDA to get at that SDK.  Oh well.

<P>I want to gauge interest in a new project.  How many of you out there (and I know there are something like 7 of you :) would actually use a utility that did the following:
<ul><li>Had a list of local directories and FTP servers/paths
<li>Monitored those dirs (timer or file change notifications) for changes.
<li>Upstream new files (based on file times) to the FTP server.  This wouldn't be a full sync but would rather be a copy.  It would never delete anything from the server.
<li>Has a tray icon to let you know what is going on.
</ul>

<P>BTW, this is a feature stolen almost verbatim from Radio.  I think that it would be useful to break it out into its own utility.

<P>The real reason I would want this is that frickin' VS.Net doesn't have a way to deply an ASP.Net application to an FTP server.  You can copy it or use FP extentions, but you can't FTP that guy up there.

<P>I would include source and an installer for this guy.
<P>If you are interested, email me at <a href="mailto:eightypercent at bedafamily.com">eightypercent at bedafamily.com</a> and I'll think about putting something together.
