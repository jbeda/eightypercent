&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve gotten some nibbles from at least 4 people on the upstreamer.  That isn&#39;t all 7 of you out there but I guess this will do :)
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll start on it this weekend or sometime early next week.  Hopefully it will go fast as I already have the FTP code.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gary.burd.info&#34;&gt;Gary Burd&lt;/a&gt; suggested a combo of ssh, rsync and a crontab entry. It looks like you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://optics.ph.unimelb.edu.au/help/rsync/&#34;&gt;install RSync on windows&lt;/a&gt; if you try hard enough. However, I don&#39;t have that much control over all of the machines that I want to upload to, so this looks like a non-starter -- at least for me.  Getting a more secure connection would be nice, though.
&lt;p&gt;I also was thinking about taking advantage of the shadow copy stuff in XP but it looks like you need to sign an NDA to get at that SDK.  Oh well.

      <title>FTP Upstreamer project</title>

&lt;P&gt;I want to gauge interest in a new project.  How many of you out there (and I know there are something like 7 of you :) would actually use a utility that did the following:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a list of local directories and FTP servers/paths
&lt;li&gt;Monitored those dirs (timer or file change notifications) for changes.
&lt;li&gt;Upstream new files (based on file times) to the FTP server.  This wouldn&#39;t be a full sync but would rather be a copy.  It would never delete anything from the server.
&lt;li&gt;Has a tray icon to let you know what is going on.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;P&gt;BTW, this is a feature stolen almost verbatim from Radio.  I think that it would be useful to break it out into its own utility.

&lt;P&gt;The real reason I would want this is that frickin&#39; VS.Net doesn&#39;t have a way to deply an ASP.Net application to an FTP server.  You can copy it or use FP extentions, but you can&#39;t FTP that guy up there.

&lt;P&gt;I would include source and an installer for this guy.
&lt;P&gt;If you are interested, email me at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:eightypercent at bedafamily.com&#34;&gt;eightypercent at bedafamily.com&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;ll think about putting something together.
