      <h1><a href="http://new.eightypercent.net/post/old/00088.html">WYSIWYG in JoeBlogger</a></h1>

        I was finally able to find time to put true WYSIWYG HTML editing into JoeBlogger.
        Here is a current screenshot:<br />
        <img src="http://www.eightypercent.net/Stuff/JoeBlogger3.JPG" /> 
        <br />
        Notice that there is no save button.&#160; Just start a new entry and hit Upload.&#160;
        It FTPs everything that has changed to your site on a background thread. If you don't
        hit upload, it will automatically save your unpublished entry.&#160; I really like
        the UI model with no explicit "save" functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        I stole the HTML editing control code (which is really a wrapper around IE's rendering
        engine: Trident) from <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's</a> <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a">BlogX</a>.&#160;
        He stole it from Nikhil Kothari&#160;who wrote it originally&#160;<a href="http://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a> <a href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/default.aspx?tabindex=4&amp;tabid=46">WebMatrix</a> project.&#160;
        The HTML -&gt; XHTML conversion code was written by Andrew Lin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that JoeBlogger is a very different project than BlogX.&#160; BlogX is a client/server
        solution that has the canonical data store on the server.&#160; It requires a ASP.Net
        server to run the server side part (Actually, you could probably write a different
        server that expose the same API, but you get the idea).&#160; JoeBlogger is a client
        side only solution that doesn't have <em>any</em> server side code at all.&#160; All
        of the pages are generated on the client and uploaded to the server.&#160; As long
        as you have FTP access to your web server (and almost everyone does) you are set. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in getting&#160;a look at the JoeBlogger source, let me know
        and I can give you an early drop of the source.&#160; I'll probably add some more
        features (and a decent setup) and then release it.

      <h1><a href="http://new.eightypercent.net/post/old/00087.html">New ISP?</a></h1>

    <p>
        I'd like to switch to a new ISP. Here is what I'm looking for: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reasonable rates. I'm thinking ~$20/month tops. 
        </li>
        <li>
            ASP.Net hosting 
        </li>
        <li>
            500Mb to 1Gb of space. I'd like to be able to put a lot of pictures up there. 
        </li>
        <li>
            No frills support 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reasonable access to log files. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It seems like there are a ton of LAMP shops out there offering a deal like this but
        I can't find anything that will host ASP.Net. Anyone know anything I don't? Do i have
        to get a bunch of friends together and colocate a box? Most places look like they
        really rip you on extra storage space. If I can't find anything good then I may drop
        the ASP.Net requirement and do most everything client side and FTP static pages up
        like I'm doing now. 
    </p>

        Email me at 'Eightypercent at Bedafamily.com' if you have any ideas for me.
