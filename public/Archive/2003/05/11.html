        Here are some answers to some of his questions:

            JoeBlogger does, by default now, produce XHTML compatible output.&#160; I don't have
            it saving out &lt;xhtml:body&gt; to the&#160;RSS feed yet.&#160; I'll get around to
            that eventually.&#160; Please download it and play with it and let me know what you
            think!</li>
        <li>
            I got no problem with people linking to stuff that I mirror.&#160; Just link to me
            and send me the flow!</li>
        <li>
            I am working in the same group that is doing the Longhorn desktop compositor.&#160;
            If you look at these videos <a href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/0509/kaigai01.htm">here</a>&#160;from
            WinHEC (a Japanese site, no less!), you can see KerryHam's hands.&#160; Kerry is one
            of the PMs in our group and, now that she is an internet celebrety, we are going to
            start up the Kerry fan club -- alt.fan.kerry.&#160; Let me know if you want to join.&#160;
            I'm working to help design (along with a bunch of others -- <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> included)a
            set of APIs that we haven't made public yet.&#160; Stay tuned for the PDC to see what
            I'm doing.</li>
        <li>
            I don't hate all New York.&#160; It is too big a place for that.&#160; I definitely
            don't like the Yankees, though.&#160; A while ago I read an article in the NY Times
            Sunday Magazine that basically said, "Why is Washington, DC, the capitol of the US
            when everyone knows that NY is the true center."&#160; I guess that a few experiences
            like that has tained me.</li>
        <li>
            I'm really excited about the server and what we can do with it.&#160; For instance,
            I'd love to have a real CVS server.&#160; (GDN workspaces only lets you check out
            one file at a time and SourceForge isn't very MS friendly...) I know someone else
            who (I think) is doing something similar to my co-op idea, but I don't want to "out"
            him.&#160; If anyone has experience doing this stuff, I'm all ears.&#160; This could&#160;
            become a pretty popular model for stepping up from a regular web hosting type account.</li>

        Instead of switching to a new ISP, I'm thinking of getting a bunch of friends together
        and buying a box and colocating it.&#160; Here is how the math works out: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1U server hosting: $100/mo.&#160; There are a couple places in seattle that i've found
            that offer this kind of deal.&#160; $100 seems to be the starting price. 
        </li>
        <li>
            1U server: ~$1200.&#160; This all depends on how much you want to spend.&#160; Since
            there won't be someone backing this stuff up for us, a RAID mirroring config is probably
            best.&#160; It looks like <a href="http://www.ironsystems.com/">iron systems</a> might
            have some decent machines.&#160; I spec'd out a 1.47GHz Athlon w/ 256MB of memory
            and 2 160GB disks w/ HW RAID for $1200. 
        </li>
        <li>
            OS: Install something free or step up to Windows 2k3 :)&#160; Being a MS employee,
            I can get a deal.&#160; This could be an extra $1000, depending.&#160; When the web
            edition is released it will probably be a lot cheaper. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So, assuming that I can get 5 people together on this total, the start up cost will
        be $250-$450 each.&#160; The montly cost will be somewhere around $20 each.&#160;
        With 6 people, we can get the startup cost down to $200-$360 each.&#160; I'd probably
        want to charge more per month so that there is an ongoing slush fund for machine upgrades
        and fixes and such. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding SQL server is another $5k.&#160; Chances are I won't need anything that industrial
        strength.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, for a very reasonable price ($450 + $20/mo) you can get your very own W2k3 machine
        in a data center that you can do anything you want to.&#160; BTW, 160GB is a ton of
        disk space to have on the net.&#160; Beyond this, you also have to worry about back
        ups and applying the latest security patches... 
    </p>
    <p>
        Has anyone out there done this?&#160; How is it working out?&#160; Words of advice?

        I finally cleaned up my blogging software enough to release the source and an install
        package.&#160; There is a screenshot <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/05/03.html#a88">here</a>.
        I'm releasing this as 0.9.0. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/License.txt">License</a> 
        <br />

        <br />
        <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-src-0.9.0.zip">Source</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've installed the binaries, there is a readme on what to do next installed
        into the programs directory.&#160; You have to copy some stuff around and edit some
        xml files to configure what is going on.&#160; If any of this is unclear, let me know
        and I'll update the readme.&#160; The readme is <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/Readme-0.9.0.txt">here</a> also. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the basic architecture: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All data exists in <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger</code>.&#160; If you want
            to back up your site, this is the thing to back up. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Config/Site1.Config</code> is a private config
            file with various file paths and FTP server information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> is everything that gets uploaded
            to the server.&#160; This includes the raw XML source data and the generated html
            files.&#160; If you have images or other files in that directory also, they will get
            uploaded for you. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1/Config/Site.Config</code> contains public
            config information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            When publishing the client generates the site into the <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> dir
            and then uploads that to the FTP server. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Play around with it, send me any deltas you have and spread the word!
