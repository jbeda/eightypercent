        &lt;a href=&#34;http://objective.mine.nu/archive/2003/5/11.aspx#when:23:03:57.7891968&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; was
        nice enough to link to me and some of the latest highlights.&amp;#160; Thanks Chris!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Here are some answers to some of his questions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            JoeBlogger does, by default now, produce XHTML compatible output.&amp;#160; I don&#39;t have
            it saving out &amp;lt;xhtml:body&amp;gt; to the&amp;#160;RSS feed yet.&amp;#160; I&#39;ll get around to
            that eventually.&amp;#160; Please download it and play with it and let me know what you
            think!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I got no problem with people linking to stuff that I mirror.&amp;#160; Just link to me
            and send me the flow!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I am working in the same group that is doing the Longhorn desktop compositor.&amp;#160;
            If you look at these videos &lt;a href=&#34;http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/0509/kaigai01.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;from
            WinHEC (a Japanese site, no less!), you can see KerryHam&#39;s hands.&amp;#160; Kerry is one
            of the PMs in our group and, now that she is an internet celebrety, we are going to
            start up the Kerry fan club -- alt.fan.kerry.&amp;#160; Let me know if you want to join.&amp;#160;
            I&#39;m working to help design (along with a bunch of others -- &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simplegeek.com&#34;&gt;ChrisAn&lt;/a&gt; included)a
            set of APIs that we haven&#39;t made public yet.&amp;#160; Stay tuned for the PDC to see what
            I&#39;m doing.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I don&#39;t hate all New York.&amp;#160; It is too big a place for that.&amp;#160; I definitely
            don&#39;t like the Yankees, though.&amp;#160; A while ago I read an article in the NY Times
            Sunday Magazine that basically said, &#34;Why is Washington, DC, the capitol of the US
            when everyone knows that NY is the true center.&#34;&amp;#160; I guess that a few experiences
            like that has tained me.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I&#39;m really excited about the server and what we can do with it.&amp;#160; For instance,
            I&#39;d love to have a real CVS server.&amp;#160; (GDN workspaces only lets you check out
            one file at a time and SourceForge isn&#39;t very MS friendly...) I know someone else
            who (I think) is doing something similar to my co-op idea, but I don&#39;t want to &#34;out&#34;
            him.&amp;#160; If anyone has experience doing this stuff, I&#39;m all ears.&amp;#160; This could&amp;#160;
            become a pretty popular model for stepping up from a regular web hosting type account.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    Check &lt;a href=&#34;http://seablogs.hellbent.org/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out.&amp;#160; Someone is putting
    GeoURL to good use.&amp;#160; It is a clickable map of the Seattle area.

    &lt;p&gt;
        Instead of switching to a new ISP, I&#39;m thinking of getting a bunch of friends together
        and buying a box and colocating it.&amp;#160; Here is how the math works out: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            1U server hosting: $100/mo.&amp;#160; There are a couple places in seattle that i&#39;ve found
            that offer this kind of deal.&amp;#160; $100 seems to be the starting price. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            1U server: ~$1200.&amp;#160; This all depends on how much you want to spend.&amp;#160; Since
            there won&#39;t be someone backing this stuff up for us, a RAID mirroring config is probably
            best.&amp;#160; It looks like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ironsystems.com/&#34;&gt;iron systems&lt;/a&gt; might
            have some decent machines.&amp;#160; I spec&#39;d out a 1.47GHz Athlon w/ 256MB of memory
            and 2 160GB disks w/ HW RAID for $1200. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            OS: Install something free or step up to Windows 2k3 :)&amp;#160; Being a MS employee,
            I can get a deal.&amp;#160; This could be an extra $1000, depending.&amp;#160; When the web
            edition is released it will probably be a lot cheaper. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        So, assuming that I can get 5 people together on this total, the start up cost will
        be $250-$450 each.&amp;#160; The montly cost will be somewhere around $20 each.&amp;#160;
        With 6 people, we can get the startup cost down to $200-$360 each.&amp;#160; I&#39;d probably
        want to charge more per month so that there is an ongoing slush fund for machine upgrades
        and fixes and such. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Adding SQL server is another $5k.&amp;#160; Chances are I won&#39;t need anything that industrial
        strength.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        So, for a very reasonable price ($450 + $20/mo) you can get your very own W2k3 machine
        in a data center that you can do anything you want to.&amp;#160; BTW, 160GB is a ton of
        disk space to have on the net.&amp;#160; Beyond this, you also have to worry about back
        ups and applying the latest security patches... 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Has anyone out there done this?&amp;#160; How is it working out?&amp;#160; Words of advice? 
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JoeBlogger 0.9.0</title>
      <link>http://www.eightypercent.net/post/old/00094.html</link>

    &lt;p&gt;
        I finally cleaned up my blogging software enough to release the source and an install
        package.&amp;#160; There is a screenshot &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/05/03.html#a88&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
        I&#39;m releasing this as 0.9.0. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/License.txt&#34;&gt;License&lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-0.9.0.msi&#34;&gt;MSI install&lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-src-0.9.0.zip&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Once you&#39;ve installed the binaries, there is a readme on what to do next installed
        into the programs directory.&amp;#160; You have to copy some stuff around and edit some
        xml files to configure what is going on.&amp;#160; If any of this is unclear, let me know
        and I&#39;ll update the readme.&amp;#160; The readme is &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/Readme-0.9.0.txt&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; also. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Here is the basic architecture: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            All data exists in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;My Documents&amp;gt;/JoeBlogger&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#160; If you want
            to back up your site, this is the thing to back up. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;My Documents&amp;gt;/JoeBlogger/Config/Site1.Config&lt;/code&gt; is a private config
            file with various file paths and FTP server information. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;My Documents&amp;gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1&lt;/code&gt; is everything that gets uploaded
            to the server.&amp;#160; This includes the raw XML source data and the generated html
            files.&amp;#160; If you have images or other files in that directory also, they will get
            uploaded for you. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;My Documents&amp;gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1/Config/Site.Config&lt;/code&gt; contains public
            config information. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            When publishing the client generates the site into the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;My Documents&amp;gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1&lt;/code&gt; dir
            and then uploads that to the FTP server. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Play around with it, send me any deltas you have and spread the word! 
    &lt;/p&gt;
