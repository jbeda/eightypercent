        &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.neelbubba.com/&#34;&gt;Bubba&lt;/a&gt; has some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.neelbubba.com/Thesis/Archive/2003_05_01_index.php#95045729&#34;&gt;interesting
        ideas&lt;/a&gt; around subscribing to an entire site instead of just &#34;news.&#34;&amp;#160; He is
        doing his Master&#39;s thesis on blogging so he has been spending a lot of time thinking
        about htis stuff. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        RSS is a part of the puzzle but only captures a part of what is on a site.&amp;#160; What
        would you need to move in to the post browser era? 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            A &#34;site.xml&#34; file to describe the type of content available at the site. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            This could point to a set of blogs available on that site.&amp;#160; Bubba (and a lot
            of others) expose more than one blog, or view of their blog.&amp;#160; Perhaps this is
            just a pointer to an RSS file. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Included in each RSS file a pointer to the archive for that is important too.&amp;#160;
            Winer has some stuff on that a while ago that could easily be integrated here. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            A reference from the &#34;site.xml&#34; file to other resources available on that site.&amp;#160;
            This could include a list of &#34;stories&#34; and photo galleries.&amp;#160; Perhaps specific
            pages like a disclaimer/license page, a contacts page, etc. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            We could use XHTML for all unstructured content that isn&#39;t covered otherwise. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This is an incremental&amp;#160;start on the semantic web.&amp;#160; If we start with XHTML
        and start pulling stuff out on a piece by piece basis we can start to reduce the amount
        of unstructured content. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Any other ideas?&amp;#160; Send me mail or post them to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; blog.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
