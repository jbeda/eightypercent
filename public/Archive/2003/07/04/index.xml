    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;m back in Seattle for good!&amp;#160; Yay! 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        On top of that, Rachel and I took this week off to move and buy a house.&amp;#160; We&#39;ve
        made an offer and they have accepted!&amp;#160; The inspection is on Sunday and we are
        figuring out mortgage and insurance stuff.&amp;#160; The house is in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://montlake.net/montlake.asp&#34;&gt;Montlake&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood
        of Seattle.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The house is withing walking distance to the University hospital so, Rachel can walk
        to work most of the time.&amp;#160; The rest of the time there are free shuttles that
        run from the U hospital to the other hospitals around Seattle.&amp;#160; The house is
        also close enough to the freeway bus stop so I can stop sitting in my car and start
        sitting in a bus.&amp;#160; Microsoft has a really good bus commuter program where anyone
        can get a free bus pass. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        So, in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simplegeek.com&#34;&gt;great historic tradition&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;I may
        get busy with the house, the move and work and I may not be posting much. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
