    Just to give Scoble some &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/18.html#a3852&#34;&gt;back
    up&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; I&#39;m planning on being at the PDC.&amp;#160; If you are there and want to
    talk about the new Graphics APIs, I&#39;m one of the guys to find.&amp;#160; If I don&#39;t end
    up presenting a session or two you can be sure that I worked hard on the slide decks.

    &lt;p&gt;
        The house stuff is winding down.&amp;#160; We close on August 18th, and I think that we
        are mostly on cruise control until then.&amp;#160; We needed the owners to put a new roof
        on the house, so there was quite a bit of back and forth on that.&amp;#160; I think we
        have it worked out now!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, this last weekend I went to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imsa93.org/&#34;&gt;10 year
        high school&lt;/a&gt; reunion.&amp;#160; It was a blast!&amp;#160; I should put some pictures up...
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        (The reasons that I don&#39;t post any pictures is that I want to make JoeBlogger have
        a picture gallery mode and I haven&#39;t gotten around to coding it up yet.&amp;#160; I should
        really get off my ass and do it.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
