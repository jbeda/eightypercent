      <title>Comments by Haloscan</title>

    &lt;p&gt;
        I finally signed up at Haloscan and now have comments up here.&amp;#160; I don&#39;t know
        if any of my 2 readers will care, but let&#39;s see what happens.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        After the first outage at Haloscan, I&#39;ll probably give up and write my own comment
        system.&amp;#160; I want to keep it seperate from JoeBlogger though so that JoeBlogger
        is still a client render/FTP too.&amp;#160; The comment system will probably be similar
        to Haloscan in the way it is hosted on a page.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OSX not a 64 bit OS</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/old/00124.html</link>

    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/06/26.html&#34;&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I was
        wondering if the new G5 Macs would have an OS that could take advantage of their 64
        bit nature, or if Apple was going to take a short cut and run the G5 in a compat mode.&amp;#160;
        Apparently, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going to be the case, at least according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/31995.html&#34;&gt;this
        Register article&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In a lot of ways, this is just more hype from Apple.&amp;#160; Many Intel processesors
        (I don&#39;t know the exact ones) actually have a 36 bit addressing bus.&amp;#160; Those extra
        4 bits mean that the processor can actually address 16 times as much memory as a 32
        bit addressing bus.&amp;#160; The difference is between 4GB and 64GB.&amp;#160; However, most
        Windows machines don&#39;t take advantage of that extra capacity.&amp;#160; The APIs &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp?frame=true&#34;&gt;are
        there&lt;/a&gt; though, if you want to use them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        So, is the 64 bit nature of the G5 hype?&amp;#160; As far as I can tell, right now the
        answer is yes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        (Well, I&#39;m sure that someone will port 64 bit Linux to it, and that will be cool.&amp;#160;
        It might become the cheapest way to get a 64 bit linux machine, if AMD doesn&#39;t beat
        them to the punch)
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
