      <h1><a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/post/old/00141.html">Joel on Unicode</a></h1>
      <span class="lead">Tue, Oct 14, 2003</span>
      <div class="post">
        

    <p>
        I'm sure everyone has seen this now, but <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/10.html">Joel
        is dead on</a> wrt Unicode.&#160; I worked on some of the codepage reloading stuff
        in IE so I've lived some of this stuff -- Both recognizing the BOM for Unicode and
        implementing the reload of an already started page when we hit the codepage meta.&#160;
        Most of IE is fully unicode of course.&#160; The only exception is when we deal with
        URLs because, back in the day, they were restricted to 7bit ascii. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some other issues that Joel didn't bring up that devs should be aware of: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sorting unicode is hard.&#160; Each language has its own sort rules.&#160; Given any
            particular set of strings, they may be sorted differently depending on the language. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Capitilization can be hard also.&#160; There was a bug in IE at one point where we
            didn't deal with capitilization of a japanese string right and someone's name was
            transformed into "dead body on beach."&#160; At the very least that is a rude thing
            to call someone. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Be aware that text that looks the same on the screen can be backed by different unicode
            codepoints.&#160; This is a problem with going to unicode for URLs as it makes domain
            squating more difficult to deal with.&#160; Two people might own two domains that
            look the same when typed in but are instead actually two different domains from a
            unicode codepoint point of view.&#160; As an analogy, I was looking at an ancient
            typewriter the other day that one of our PMs has outside of her office.&#160; It doesn't
            have a '1' key!&#160; The solution is to just use the 'l' (L) key instead.&#160; Now
            imagine if the keys are font glyphs as displayed on the screen and the concept of
            '1' and 'l' are unicode codepoints.&#160; 'He11o' and 'Hello' would look exactly alike
            on the screen but would actually be different domains.</li>
    </ul>

      <h1><a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/post/old/00140.html">New Computer</a></h1>
      <span class="lead">Tue, Oct 14, 2003</span>
      <div class="post">
        

    <p>
        The reason I haven't been posting is that I've been setting up a new computer here
        at home.&#160; I got rid of my 1.4GHz Athlon and replaced it with a sweet 2.8GHz P4.&#160;
        The 800MHz memory interface along with a new <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/index.php?LT=english&amp;Language_s=2&amp;url_place=product&amp;p_serial=TAC-T01&amp;other_title=+TAC-T01+Wave%20Master">case</a>&#160;and
        mirrored RAID 120GB SATA drives make this a sweet ride.&#160; The main reason that
        I upgraded is that I've been taking a ton of photos and I haven't been as diligent
        at backing them up as I should be.&#160; The mirrored drives are an extra level of
        insurance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus, blue LEDs just look sweet.&#160; Now all I need is a big tailpipe and "Powered
        by HKS" stickers! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't picked a new videocard yet.&#160; But when I do, I'm going to get the most
        powerful thing that I can afford.&#160; Come to the PDC and you'll see what I've been
        working on and why!
