    &lt;p&gt;
        I don&#39;t know how many people care, but I&#39;m sorry that I haven&#39;t been posting lately!&amp;#160;
        I&#39;ll try to make that up some.&amp;#160; Anyway, here is an update of what has been happening: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Went to Cabo San Lucas for a week and relaxed.&amp;#160; It was great to sit in the sun
            at the beach, order a bucket of beers and eat tacos. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Adopted two dogs.&amp;#160; Their names are Lady and Cocoa.&amp;#160; Lady is one and a half
            years old and was rescued from a meth lab and was probably abused.&amp;#160; She hasn&#39;t
            shown many signs of it, but you never know what is going to trigger memories of abuse.&amp;#160;
            She had a litter of puppies when she was really young.&amp;#160; Cocoa is the one puppy
            for which the rescuers didn&#39;t find a home.&amp;#160; He was her favorite puppy, so we
            adopted them as a pair.&amp;#160; More details and pictures to come later. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I celebrated the one year anniversary of my blog by not posting.&amp;#160; You can find
            the first post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/01/09.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from
            Janurary 9, 2003. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Read lots and lots of books.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve been reading ebooks on my PocketPC on the
            bus to and from work every day.&amp;#160; I love ebooks! 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Started writing some ASP.Net code for a picture gallery over at bedafamily.com.&amp;#160;
            I&#39;d love to finish this up so that I can easily post lots of photos.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;ve started recovering from the hibernation that is winter in Seattle.&amp;#160; I want
        to start talking more about what is going on in Avalon and life in general.
    &lt;/p&gt;
