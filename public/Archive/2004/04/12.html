    <p>
        Here in Windows (and in other groups around the company) we have a system that is
        generally called stress.&#160; Different groups have different implementations, but
        the idea is always the same.&#160; You develop a test suite that hammers you system
        and&#160;then have everyone install it and run it overnight.&#160; The idea is that
        this way we can catch those hard to repro issues that only our customers see. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When you get one of these errors, what do you do with it?&#160; Generally there is
        a team of people who have the thankless job of coming in early, finding all the machines
        that have broken in to the debugger, logging the failures in a database and having
        the system send mail to various people to investigate.&#160; The actual debugging
        is done via the NT command line debugger (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/ddk/debugging/default.mspx">cdb</a>)
        redirected over the network via the remote.exe utility.&#160; It is up to this team
        to figure out which issues have already been caught and fixed (but perhaps aren't
        in the build yet) and what issues are new and need to be investigated.&#160; These
        guys cover a lot of code so the generally don't have the knowledge to figure out what
        developer should be looking at any particular problem.&#160; That falls to the rotating
        list of people who are on "stress duty."&#160; The shell team calls it "dev of the
        day."&#160; We've learned by hard experience that if you send these types of things
        to a big mailing list, they either get ignored or the same sorry glutton for punishment
        picks up all of the issues. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I happen to be on stress duty this week.&#160; My job is to handle, in as expedient
        a fashion as possible, any incoming issues.&#160;&#160;I&#160;have to do my best to
        exercise&#160;my debugging skills and try to figure out what is going on.&#160; BTW, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond
        Chen</a> is one of the undisputed masters of the cdb kung-fu.&#160; If I can figure
        out what is going on myself, I can file a bug on the issue and let the person whose
        machine I'm debugging reclaim their machine.&#160; If the problem is in code that
        I don't know well it is my job to reassign the issue to someone who does know the
        code well.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond handling incoming stress breaks in the morning, I also have to be responsive
        to all sorts of other issues that might get dropped on the floor.&#160; This includes
        other random crashes people might have during the day along with helping out to resolve
        any build breaks.&#160; (We try super hard to make sure that build breaks don't happen,
        but with something the size of Windows it still sometimes happens.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Do other companies have systems like this set up?&#160; I'd be interested to hear
        what works for you.

        Over on Channel9, there was an <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1653">interesting
        question</a> about the history of how my team in Avalon decide to split our component
        between managed and unmanaged code.
