    &lt;p&gt;
        Ha! I get linked from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=106586&amp;amp;cid=9070786&#34;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; and
        I see a spike in traffic.&amp;#160; Slashdot is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; flow machine.&amp;#160; In any
        case, there are some misstatements in that comment that I&#39;d like to answer.&amp;#160;
        First, I&#39;m not &#34;the guy from Microsoft behind Avalon.&#34;&amp;#160; Rather I&#39;m one on a large
        team of developers.&amp;#160; My particular area is the graphics APIs.&amp;#160; Avalon is
        much more than just graphics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Second, managed code is a different beast that unmanaged code.&amp;#160; While it can
        make programmers more productive and I totally think that it is the way of the future,
        a developer can write bad code in any language.&amp;#160; While right now I don&#39;t think
        that anyone would claim that managed code is faster than unmanaged code, the difference
        is generally not that great.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve heard of some research that suggests that
        future JITs may be able to apply run time directed optimizations and recompilation
        that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make managed code faster.&amp;#160; But that world isn&#39;t here yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In the parlance of our time: &#34;Just&amp;#160;my 2 cents&#34;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WinHEC report</title>

    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;m done with my part of helping make WinHEC a success.&amp;#160; My talk went off pretty
        well and we got some great questions and comments.&amp;#160; I also worked the booth and
        showed&amp;#160;industry and press people what Longhorn can do.&amp;#160; The big news for
        the WinHEC release is that we now have a start to our 3D APIs.&amp;#160; We had a couple
        of examples that show mixing 3D and 2D in a seamless way.&amp;#160; I tried to go out
        of my way to make sure that everyone knew that Avalon was much more than just graphics.&amp;#160;
        We are a full UI platoform that includes controls, styling, databinding, etc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The main demo I was showing was a simulated &#34;blood sugar tracker.&#34;&amp;#160; It essentially
        has a 3D bar graph in the background that slowly rotates.&amp;#160; Layered on that are
        semi-transparent buttons.&amp;#160; There is also a details panel that can come up that
        is semi-transparent and has another 3D scene hosted inside of it.&amp;#160; We have a
        vector graphic doctor icon in the corner that you can zoom in on to see that it is
        rasterized at the device resolution.&amp;#160; The really impressive thing here is that
        our demo team (a dev and a designer) took 2-3 days to turn this from an email idea
        into reality.&amp;#160; Robert and &lt;a href=&#34;http://longhornblogs.com/ndunlap/&#34;&gt;Nathan&lt;/a&gt; did
        a great job of showing the power of Avalon.&amp;#160; Here is a screen shot:
