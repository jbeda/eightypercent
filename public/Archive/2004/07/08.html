      <h1><a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/post/old/00194.html">How the TSA tried to kill me</a></h1>

      <div class="post">
        

    <p>
        I recently went to New Zealand.&#160; Since it is an outdoorsy type of place I put
        my camelback water bladder/backpack in my big duffle bag and had a great time.&#160;
        Since I'm a responsible hiker, I have a standard emergency kit in my backpack that
        contains things like a compass, foil space blanket, ace bandage, banana powerbars
        (these are so gross I'll only eat them in an emergency), etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Cut to me&#160;going on a hike last Monday and grab my trusty back with the kit already
        put together.&#160; I wanted to put something in my emergency pack and noticed a slip
        of paper from the TSA informing me that they had confiscated my pack of 25 windproof
        matches.&#160; If I had a scanner I would post an image of&#160;the notice.&#160;
        The rule apparently is that knives must go in your checked baggage and matches must
        be in your carryon baggage.&#160; Don't ask me to explain this.&#160; Also don't ask
        me to explain why I can't use my PocketPC to read books during takeoff and landing.&#160;
        These things cannot be explained. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, imagine that I had gotten lost in the mountains last Monday and it started to
        get cold.&#160; Normal people would have dispaired and rolled over and died.&#160;
        But not me!&#160; I was a boy scout and was prepared ("Be prepared, its the motto
        of the Boy Scouts!").&#160; I'd reach in to my emergency kit to get my matches to
        start a fire.&#160; Instead of finding life saving matches I would instead find a
        very official looking notice from the TSA letting me know that I'm screwed.
