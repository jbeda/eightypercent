    &lt;p&gt;
        A couple of buddies of mine (Avi and Ken) both have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lomography.com/about/&#34;&gt;Lomo
        cameras&lt;/a&gt; that they shoot with.&amp;#160; For the uninitiated, these are super low tech
        cameras that are mass produced in Russia.&amp;#160; There is no autofocus but instead
        a choice of 4 (count &#39;em -- four) focus settings.&amp;#160; These cameras are so simple
        and bulletproof, that using them is more of a philosophy than a tool.&amp;#160; The whole
        idea is to experiment and play.&amp;#160; On top of that, the lens isn&#39;t sharp corner
        to corner and it has quite a bit if vignetting.&amp;#160; That&#39;s okay -- it adds to the
        Lomo look.&amp;#160; If I still shot film, I would pick one of these up right away.&amp;#160;
        I may pick one up anyway.&amp;#160; In essence, these cameras are the anti-digital camera. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you aren&#39;t willing to go that far, there is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lensbabies.com/&#34;&gt;lensbaby&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        I have one of these on order.&amp;#160; This is a super simple lens for you SLR.&amp;#160;
        It is a single lens attached to some flexible tubing.&amp;#160; You focus by using your
        fingertips to move the lens in and out.&amp;#160; You can also tilt the focus plane.&amp;#160;
        This lens also has quite a bit of blur and vignetting.&amp;#160; And it works on digital
        SLRs?&amp;#160; This thing is so old school that you have to manually take it apart to
        change the aperture.&amp;#160; Sure, you could get the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 lens cheaper
        -- and it has autofocus and an adjustable apature.&amp;#160; But there is something cool
        about the look and feel of the images form this lens.&amp;#160; Check out some of the
        photos &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lensbabies.com/pages/gall_strong.php&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; (I
        want to post photos but I don&#39;t want to steal anybody&#39;s images.) 
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Great BBQ, Scoble!</title>

    Yesterday Rachel and I &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/07.html#a8048&#34;&gt;went
    over to the Scoble estate&lt;/a&gt; for a BBQ.&amp;#160; It was great to see Robert and Maryam.&amp;#160;
    The food and company was excellent.&amp;#160; The conversation drifted between geeky things
    (cameras, HDTV, Tivo/Media Center) and other non geeky things (jokes, BBQ technique,
    etc.)&amp;#160; I also finially met Mr. Winer -- an interesting experience.
