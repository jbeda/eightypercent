    &lt;p&gt;
        Rachel and I went to a reading from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312324839/qid=1094054140/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-5121671-1377764?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846&#34;&gt;&#34;On
        Call: A Doctor&#39;s Days and Nights in Residency&#34; by Emily Transue&lt;/a&gt; last night.&amp;#160;
        Emily is a friend of ours and was my wife Rachel&#39;s chief resident when she started
        residency.&amp;#160; I haven&#39;t had a chance to read the book yet (we picked up a copy
        last night) but, from the excerpts that Emily read aloud, it sounds great.&amp;#160; If
        you don&#39;t know someone who&#39;s been through residency (or even if you do!) this book
        will give you an understanding of the ups and downs -- both emotionally and physically
        -- that a doctor goes through during residency.&amp;#160; I saw it up close and personal
        while Rachel was going through it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Trivia: That picture on the cover isn&#39;t her.&amp;#160; But the coat is hers.&amp;#160; She
        had to send it to New York for a couple of weeks to be photographed.&amp;#160; She &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have
        a picture on the inside of the sleeve. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
