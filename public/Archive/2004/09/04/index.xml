    &lt;p&gt;
        I met with HR yesterday afternoon to turn in my batch and my corporate AmEx card.&amp;#160;
        It felt like a cheesy cop show:&amp;#160; &#34;Gimme your badge and your gun, Mahoney -- you&#39;re
        suspended!&#34;&amp;#160; Right after that I went back to my building and had a buddy sign
        me in as a visitor so that we could all hang out and play some xbox.&amp;#160; It&amp;#160;was
        hard to let go and not get involved in the discussions going on in the hallways.&amp;#160;
        The day before a large group of us went out for my goodbye lunch.&amp;#160; It felt a
        little bit like a funeral in its finality.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        First off, I&#39;d like to say that everyone has been really good about my leaving --
        both inside and outside of the company.&amp;#160; I think that most everyone understands
        that 7 years is a long time and that I&#39;ve &#34;done my time.&#34;&amp;#160; Thanks for all of
        the Congrats!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        There are a set of reaction posts and comments that are interesting.&amp;#160; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.longhornblogs.com/akinney/archive/2004/09/02/5125.aspx&#34;&gt;Adam
        Kinney&lt;/a&gt; was first off the line. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/627ef915-1661-4906-ae07-a99e02cd83ae&#34;&gt;ChrisAn&lt;/a&gt; also
        had some nice stuff to say.&amp;#160; I got contacted by a reporter from CNet looking
        for a story.&amp;#160; There really is no big story, but she ended up writing a &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.com.com/2061-1032-5347491.html&#34;&gt;short
        blurb&lt;/a&gt; in &#34;news.blog.&#34;&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Looking at macro trends, check out the comments to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=5192cf7a-fe03-47b7-953f-72d61abace97&#34;&gt;Dare&#39;s
        post&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; My buddy Vince at articulatebabble.com (who I broke the news to a
        day or two before) had some comments on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.articulatebabble.org/archives/2004/09/02T085804.php&#34;&gt;Microsoft
        and Google&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Finally, over at &#34;Mini-Microsoft&#34;, Who da&#39;Punk &lt;a href=&#34;http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2004/09/dangerous-transitions.html&#34;&gt;fits
        my leaving&lt;/a&gt; into his smaller is better paradigm.&amp;#160; I think that he and Vince
        both have some really solid points.&amp;#160; Microsoft could do with some focusing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My plan this weekend was to get a very tall (30 foot) ladder and clean my gutters.&amp;#160;
        But since my health insurance is in a little bit of a state of limbo before I start
        at Google on Tuesday, my wife won&#39;t let me do that.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
