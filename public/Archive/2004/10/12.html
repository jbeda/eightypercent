      <div class="post">
        

    <p>
        I spent the last weekend in Chicago visiting my parents and my sister's family and
        her three adorable kids.&#160; (Hi Harper, Ellie and Tate!)
    </p>
    <p>
        We combined this trip with my wife&#160;Rachel's first marathon!&#160; We took the
        train downtown early on Sunday morning and got there in plenty of time for the start.&#160;
        It was a complete mob scene.&#160; There were 40,000 people signed up to run the marathon.&#160;
        It took Rachel 15 minutes or so to actually get to the start line.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I cut across the course and was able to see her run by at the halfway mark.&#160;
        I then took my time walking to the finish line so that I could try to catch a glimpse
        of her on the home stretch.&#160; I missed her there but was able to meet up with
        her in the park outside the finish.&#160; Right after she finished she collapsed on
        me and said that it was the hardest thing she ever did and also the best.&#160; That
        is something coming from someone who finished a medical internship.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm so proud of her running it!&#160; Now all she has to do is let her feet heal.&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        Interesting stuff:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everyone is timed with what is called a "champion chip."&#160; This is a little device
            that you tie on to your shoe that marks when you step on checkpoints along the course.&#160;
            They had 10 of these checkpoints total.&#160; I'm not sure what technology they use,
            but it seems to work pretty well.&#160; There would be no way to get an accurate time
            for 40k people without something like this.</li>
        <li>
            Right after Rachel finished someone in front of her called for a medic.&#160; A woman
            and her father had apparently just finished together when he collapsed on the ground.&#160;
            He was still talking but obviously dizzy and confused.&#160; Rachel introduced herself
            as a doctor and volunteered to help.&#160;&#160;She checked his pulse on his wrist
            and in his neck.&#160; If you have a pulse in your wrist, your blood pressure is at
            least 90.&#160; If it is in your neck it is at least 60.&#160; Since the man had a
            pulse in his neck but not in his wrist he had a blood pressure under 90.&#160; She
            sat with them until the medics arrived and he was wheeled away.&#160; We both hope
            everything is okay!</li>
        <li>
            There is a company that tries to take pictures of everyone.&#160; Apparently they
            just shoot away and try to sort it all out later.&#160; Last night when we checked
            the site they had finished going through 22% of the photos they had taken and had
            three pictures of Rachel online.&#160; I can't imagine dealing with that many pictures!&#160;
            I'm wondering if they have some sort&#160;of OCR system to read the bib numbers off
            the runners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I took some pictures but I haven't had a chance to sort through them yet.&#160; Hopefully
        I can put one or two up in the next couple of days.
