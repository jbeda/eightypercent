    <p>
        Last weekend I spent some time down near Page, AZ photographing some beautiful southwest
        scenery.&#160; Since I don't have the time or experience to plan something like this
        myself, I went with a group of people led by <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/about.htm">Steve
        Kossack</a>&#160;from <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/">f-8 and be there</a>.&#160;
        Steve takes people out on photography workshops to places that he knows very well.&#160;
        It is&#160;amazing what a difference an experienced leader can make to an expedition.&#160;
        I had a great time and got some amazing images from the trip. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My flight to Phoenix on Thursday got in around 1:30 pm.&#160; Steve and some of the
        other participants picked me up at the airport baggage claim.&#160; We were then immediately
        off on a pretty long drive up to Page.&#160; Page is right on the border between Arizona
        and Utah.&#160; It's on <a href="http://www.powellguide.com/lakepowell/lakepowellmap.html">Lake
        Powell</a>, a huge serpentine lake made by the Glen Canyon Dam.&#160; The Glen Canyon
        dam is on the Colorado upstream from the Grand Canyon. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once at page, we checked in to a hotel and started our 3 days of intense field photography.&#160;
        A typical day would be getting up early enough so that we could be at a good spot
        for sunrise.&#160; Up in the high desert this was pretty cold this time of year.&#160;
        Lows at night were somewhere around 35-40 degrees F.&#160; We would then photograph
        the sunrise.&#160; After that we would spend the day in locations that work well with
        overhead light.&#160; For this trip we photographed both upper and lower Antelope
        Canyons.&#160; These are amazing slot canyons that really have to be seen to be believed.&#160;
        As the day wears on we would travel to another amazing location for a sunset shoot. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides the wonderful landscapes, the other people on a trip like this make it a very
        enriching experience.&#160; It is refreshing to me to be out with people who enjoy
        photography so much.&#160; It takes a certain type of person to get up at 4:30am in
        the cold so that you can travel two hours to be in time for the morning light.&#160;
        One part of the workshop that I particularly enjoy is the print discussion.&#160;
        Steve encourages everyone to bring some prints of their work.&#160; Then, after living
        with each other for a couple of days, we get together to admire and discuss each others'
        work.&#160; Steve also brings some of his best work for us to look at. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in an experience like this and have&#160;a passion for photography,
        give Steve a call.&#160; His upcoming <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/workshops/rafting05.htm">Grand
        Canyon rafting trip</a> looks like a trip of a lifetime.&#160; I won't be able to
        make this one, but it looks like he has a couple of spots left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the images that I got -- here is a start: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Horseshoe Bend at dawn" hspace="0" src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/HSB-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /> 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is famous Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado river.&#160; The river&#160;carves a
        perfect circle as seen from&#160;the cliff overlooking the canyon.&#160; This was
        our first sunrise of the trip.&#160; I'm always a little rusty when starting out on
        something like this, but I'm happy with this result.&#160; The mountains in back (catching
        the sun first) are called the Vermillion Cliffs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical details: 20 images stitched together (3x7) shot from my Canon 20D with the
        24-70mm f/2.8L at 34mm.&#160; Exposure was 1/25th second at f/11 and ISO 200.&#160;
        I haven't done the full stitch yet (this is a small version) and so I don't know the
        final resolution. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Look for more images in the coming weeks as&#160;I sort through the boatload of data
        I captured.&#160; As a point of reference, I ended up with ~14GB of raw data from
        this trip.&#160; I'm going to run out of disk space! 
    </p>
