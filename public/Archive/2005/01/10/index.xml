    &lt;p&gt;
        Here is a photo that I didn&#39;t take:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; hspace=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/BabyBedaUltrasound.jpg&#34; align=&#34;baseline&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Good news!&amp;#160; We are having a baby.&amp;#160; My wife is pregnant. I know that people
        usually say &#34;we are pregnant&#34; but she is the one that went through the nausea and
        has to deal with carrying the baby around for 9 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The ultrasound from this morning looks good.&amp;#160; It is still pretty early yet (she
        is 17 weeks along -- due date is June 21st) but the ultrasound tech said that it looked
        like our baby is a girl.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Now I have to figure out how to be a father!
    &lt;/p&gt;
