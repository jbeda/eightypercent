    &lt;p&gt;
        Okay -- when people &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jbeda/231/#231881&#34;&gt;ask
        me&lt;/a&gt; to update in my comments it has probably been too long. I don&#39;t have anything
        super pithy to say, so I guess I&#39;ll just use the shotgun approach: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Everything is going good with the baby.&amp;#160; Rachel is starting to get big!&amp;#160;
            We are reading to her every night and trying to get our lives in order so that we
            are ready.&amp;#160; We are almost through &#34;The Witch and the Wardrobe.&#34; We&#39;ve been reading
            a chapter each night.&amp;#160; After we are done we will continue reading the rest of
            the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.narnia.com/&#34;&gt;Narnia&lt;/a&gt; stories out loud&amp;#160;to each other
            and the baby.&amp;#160; I know she can&#39;t understand what is going on but I want her to
            know my voice. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            We went to Chicago last weekend.&amp;#160; My Sister threw Rachel a baby shower at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourseasons.com/chicagorc/&#34;&gt;Ritz-Carlton&lt;/a&gt; downtown.&amp;#160;
            The service in the garden was wonderful.&amp;#160; My sister&#39;s two girls had an especially
            great time. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I&#39;ve been buying some cool stuff.&amp;#160; The first is my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/28.html#a224&#34;&gt;terabyte
            array&lt;/a&gt; for my main computer.&amp;#160; I ended up with five 300GB SATA drives in a
            cage running software RAID 5.&amp;#160; That comes out to ~1.2TB after you factor out
            the redundency.&amp;#160; I didn&#39;t get a dedicated machine to keep costs down.&amp;#160; I
            can always do that later and move the drives over.&amp;#160; Everything has been running
            like a champ. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Also to prepare I picked up a Canon &lt;a href=&#34;http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;amp;fcategoryid=145&amp;amp;modelid=10599&#34;&gt;SD300&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
            This is an update to our aging &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steves-digicams.com/s100.html&#34;&gt;S100&lt;/a&gt; (the
            original digital Elph) point and shoot.&amp;#160; It is amazing how much these things
            have improved.&amp;#160; I loved the S100 but the SD300 is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better.&amp;#160;
            My favorite feature is that it can do 640x480x30fps movies until the card is full.&amp;#160;
            For short clips there is no reason to get a video camera.&amp;#160; I also ordered a 1GB
            SD card but those are apparently sold out everywhere. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I&#39;m thinking about getting a new car as the baby approaches.&amp;#160; I want to take
            a serious look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://automobiles.honda.com/models/model_overview.asp?ModelName=Element&#34;&gt;Honda
            Element&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Having an interior made of rubber that you can hose down sound
            like a good idea with kids. Plus, it is only $21k completely decked out. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Between Rachel and me, we&#39;ve recently read the entire &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=raymond+chandler&#34;&gt;Raymond
            Chandler&lt;/a&gt; catalog.&amp;#160; I love his writing.&amp;#160; You can just feel vintage LA
            ooze from the pages. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I haven&#39;t been taking many photos lately.&amp;#160; I have some more stuff&amp;#160;from the&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/27.html&#34;&gt;Arizona
            trip&lt;/a&gt; that I should post.&amp;#160; I haven&#39;t put up any of my slot canyon photos yet.&amp;#160; 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Work has been going great.&amp;#160; I still can&#39;t talk about what I&#39;m working on but
            I really feel like I&#39;ve made it over the hump of moving to a new environment and I&#39;m
            starting to be really productive.&amp;#160; The contrast between Google and Microsoft
            couldn&#39;t be greater (at least from an engineer&#39;s point of view).&amp;#160; No meetings
            and few politics means that I spend much more time coding.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve written more
            code so far at Google than I have in the last year at MS.&amp;#160; (That really isn&#39;t
            apples to apples as I spent most of my time in the last year at MS writing specs.)&amp;#160;
            I totally feel like I&#39;m in the loop on my project without having to play political
            games.&amp;#160; I guess that is what happens on smaller teams. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I&#39;d love to have some intelligent comment on the whole &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html&#34;&gt;AutoLink&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=smarttags&#34;&gt;SmartTags&lt;/a&gt; thing
            as I&#39;ve been around for both.&amp;#160; However, I just don&#39;t see a clear cut answer here,
            unlike some.&amp;#160; 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;http://uploads.ungrounded.net/content.php?id=206373&amp;amp;name=206373_numanuma.swf&amp;amp;title=Numa%20Numa%20Dance&amp;amp;date=1109739600&amp;amp;quality=b&amp;amp;uj=0&amp;amp;w=500&amp;amp;h=375&#34;&gt;Numa
            Numa&lt;/a&gt;. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        That&#39;s it for now. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
