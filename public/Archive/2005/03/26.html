        Wow -- <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/05/03/25/2129248.shtml?tid=217&amp;tid=8">Slashdot</a> <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/05/23/1737226.shtml?tid=109&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=190&amp;tid=201">again</a>.&#160;
        That is always fun.&#160; I'm always amazed at the flow and I love the influx of comments
        both on Slashdot itself and on my blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        One comment was from "Dave B" asking me to elaborate on some theories as to why C++
        hasn't developed the same set of libraries that other environments such as Perl, Python,
        Java, C#, etc. have.&#160; Here are a bunch of ideas.&#160; I have no empirical data
        but just gut feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        First off, we must examine the philosophy behind different environments.&#160; I may
        be making broad generalizations here, but stay with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Java and the CLR (C#, VB.Net): "Make the easy things easy and make the hard things
            possible."&#160; These environments try to avoid the inherit complexity that C++ has.</li>
        <li>
            Python and Perl (and perhaps others that I have no experience with): "Make my life
            easier -- I don't want to spend more time writing this fast and dirty script than
            I have to".&#160; Above all else users here prize being able to get something useful
            done now.</li>
        <li>
            C++:&#160; "Give me all of the fundamental tools and building blocks and I'll do it
            myself."&#160; Power trumps all.&#160; Templates and the way that people use them
            are a great example of this.</li>
        <li>
            (I'm sure that there are more categories for things like Lisp and Smalltalk.&#160;
            Filling out that part of the list is left as an exercise to the reader)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With this difference in philosophy it is no wonder that there is such - ahem - diversity
        in the C++ library space.&#160; Here are some more thoughts.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There *are* good sets of libraries out there for doing stuff.&#160; One example would
            be <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a>.&#160; These have limited uptake I think
            for a couple of reasons.&#160; First, downloading and building these is a pain.&#160;
            They don't already come with your compiler.&#160; Second, these libraries are either
            laser focused on a specific area (libtiff?) or are more collections/algorithms base.&#160;
            Boost, for example, doesn't include an easy interface for dealing with zip files or
            for writing a single threaded select loop based network server.</li>
        <li>
            The C++ standards process is slow and ponderous.&#160; While there are downsides to
            these environments being controlled by a single entity or a focused group, but the
            end result is much faster advancement of the language/runtime/environment.</li>
        <li>
            There are so many ways to do things in C++ that invariably arguments come up over
            how to do something. Even within one company, people can't agree.&#160; For some reason
            C++ programmers seem to be more stubborn on a lot of these points.&#160;&#160;The
            result is that&#160;everyone just writes their own thing.</li>
        <li>
            It is way to easy to write super hard to use APIs in C++.&#160; Templates make this
            problem worse.&#160; If you do this stuff day in and day out you get to know it and
            it makes sense to you, but most C++ libraries are hard to use on a casual basis.&#160;
            I think that there is a disease where people think that it is their obligation to
            use templates in as confusing a way as possible.&#160; Any time a class has a templated
            base class, you are going to go right over the head of 95% of the developers out there.</li>
        <li>
            Opinions are divided around RTTI and exceptions.&#160; Code written to deal with exceptions
            doesn't interop well with code that turns exceptions off.&#160; Almost no one turns
            on RTTI.&#160; In any case, the result is that these are walls to reusing code.&#160;
            If you don't use exceptions you have to come up with your own error code space or
            use platform concepts like HRESULTs.</li>
        <li>
            Everyone likes to replace their allocator but there is no standard way to do that
            for various libraries.&#160; <em>If</em> library lets your replace the allocator it
            is usually something that has to be done on a library by library basis.&#160; So many
            problems would be solved if the CRT and language had a way to do global hooking of
            the malloc/free and new/delete at the link level.</li>
        <li>
            DLLs, shared libraries, compiler differences, differing STL support all make it harder
            to do things in a standard way.</li>
        <li>
            Windows doesn't have a good standard build system.&#160; The upshot is that libraries
            are only on Unix or the Windows build is cobbled together.&#160; Environments like
            Cygwin are really poor compromises.&#160; It would be better for everyone if the unix
            make/configure systems would be updated to work natively on Windows also. It isn't
            like Windows can change anytime soon without breaking the world.&#160; The MS compilers
            are now free -- the make system is really the only missing part now.</li>
        <li>
            Each codebase has its own way for deciding how header files are included.&#160; Figuring
            stuff like that out is just a headache.</li>
        <li>
            Lots and lots of different string types.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Does this hurt C++?&#160; Probably not -- it is just targeted at a different audience.&#160;
        When you need the power you need the power.&#160; If you have to hunt around for example
        code or a helper library and somehow jam it in to your build system and project then
        that is the price for playing the game.
    </p>

        Just some random thoughts on a Saturday morning...
