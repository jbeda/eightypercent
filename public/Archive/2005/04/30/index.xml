    &lt;p&gt;
        Rachel (my wife for those of you not playing along at home) has been struggling to
        get parking passes for our cars.&amp;#160; In our neighborhood in Seattle, you need a
        permit to park on the street for longer than 2 hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        How hard can it be to get this pass?&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/parking/parkingrpz.htm&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;says
        &#34;to have an application mailed to you, please call (206) 684-5086.&#34;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The response at that number: &#34;We&#39;re sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is
        full&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        Two days later: &#34;We&#39;re sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is full.&#34;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        So Rachel decides that this isn&#39;t working and goes downtown, parks (no easy task)
        and treks up to the 37th floor of the Seattle Municipal Tower.&amp;#160; Let me set the
        scene for you.&amp;#160; There are two workers helping citizens with their Traffic Permit
        needs.&amp;#160; There is a third that gets up to help Rachel.&amp;#160; Then there is a rotund
        woman sitting next to a ringing phone.&amp;#160; I wasn&#39;t there but I imagine that she
        had an unpleasant look on her face.&amp;#160; Let&#39;s call her Bertha.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Rachel:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&#34;I&#39;d like to get my zone parking permit&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Helpful Dude:&lt;/em&gt; &#34;Great!&amp;#160; Do you have your forms filled out and your check
        ready?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Rachel:&lt;/em&gt; &#34;No.&amp;#160; I tried calling to get the form but the voice mailbox
        was full.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Bertha (who chimes in from her chair next to a ringing phone):&lt;/em&gt; &#34;Well it isn&#39;t
        full now.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Rachel:&lt;/em&gt; &#34;I called twice and it was full both times.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Bertha: &lt;/em&gt;&#34;I just emptied it.&amp;#160; It wouldn&#39;t be full if you people didn&#39;t
        call so much.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Rachel: &lt;/em&gt;&#34;The website instructed me to call.&amp;#160; Why don&#39;t you guys just
        put a PDF of the form on the website so that people don&#39;t have to call?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Guy in next line: &lt;/em&gt;&#34;That sounds like a great idea!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Bertha:&lt;/em&gt; &#34;Nah, that would never work.&amp;#160; People wouldn&#39;t know how to download
        it or they would screw it up and it would just create more work for us.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Rachel:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&#34;All right then.&amp;#160; I&#39;ll just get my pass and be on my way.&amp;#160;
        I see that I&#39;ve done all that I can do here.&#34;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Seriously folks, I can&#39;t make this stuff up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        In honor of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/26/AR2005042600697.html&#34;&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;school
        board, I have this for you to ponder: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we were descended from dogs instead of apes, would we bother
        putting windshields on our cars? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
