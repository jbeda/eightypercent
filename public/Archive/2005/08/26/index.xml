        [In case you aren&#39;t up on the MS lingo -- the&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rofessional &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;evelopers &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;onference&lt;/a&gt; is
        the once in a while conference that Microsoft holds where they talk about all things
        Microsoft.&amp;#160; It is more forward looking than a lot of the other MS conferences.]
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;m going to the PDC to keep up with what is going on with Windows.&amp;#160; Drop me
        a line if you&#39;d like to chat about Google Talk or anything else.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;m not sure which sessions I&#39;m going to attend yet, but I can tell you that my interests
        have shifted somewhat since I&#39;ve shipped software on the outside.&amp;#160; I&#39;m much more
        interested in stuff that can help make Google Talk better now than more forward looking
        stuff that may not ship for another year yet.&amp;#160; I&#39;m also a lot less interested
        in huge frameworks that tie my product to Windows.&amp;#160; While Google Talk is right
        now just a Windows only application, we&#39;ve worked hard to keep the Win32 only stuff
        isolated so that it will be easier for us to port/write on other platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        That being said, is anyone working on an Avalon/.Net Jabber/XMPP client?&amp;#160; I&#39;ve
        been looking at the SSL/TLS support in the WinFX SDK and it might be possible to do
        it without any reliance on external libraries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
