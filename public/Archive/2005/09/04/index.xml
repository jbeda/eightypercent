    &lt;p&gt;
        I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/09/02.html&#34;&gt;left Microsoft for
        Google&lt;/a&gt; one year ago today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;ve got to be honest; it was a little scary when I left.&amp;#160; I started at Microsoft
        right out of college after two internships.&amp;#160; Up until a year ago, the lion&#39;s
        share of my professional experience had been at Microsoft.&amp;#160; Microsoft can be
        a very comfortable place (much less so since they&#39;ve been cutting benefits).&amp;#160;
        From the outside, I&#39;ve also been able to look at Microsoft with different eyes.&amp;#160;
        What I used to rationalize away now appears &lt;a href=&#34;http://battellemedia.com/archives/001835.php&#34;&gt;absurd
        on the face&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It is one year&amp;#160;later and I&#39;m sure that I made the right decision.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve
        been much happier over the last year at Google.&amp;#160; I&#39;m sure some of it was the
        excitement of just doing something different, but a lot of it really came from the
        energy of those I work with and actually &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249&#34;&gt;shipping
        product&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Oh yeah, and my non-compete and non-solicit contracts with Microsoft have now expired.&amp;#160;
        If you are looking for new challenges feel free to send me a resume.
    &lt;/p&gt;
