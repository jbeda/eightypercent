    &lt;p&gt;
        Coming in this morning, I heard a&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5567184&#34;&gt;segment
        on NPR&lt;/a&gt; covering a unique program that King Country is running to provide &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.desc.org/1811.html&#34;&gt;rooms
        for homeless alcoholics&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle.&amp;#160; The unique and controversial part of
        this program is that the residents can continue to drink. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My wife, Rachel, has first hand experience with this problem from her work at the
        Harborview ER.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Some of these &#34;frequent fliers&#34; are indeed part of the community
        at the ER. In fact, one of the patients that Rachel had lots of interactions with
        (ever since she was a med student!) recently died and it really shook her up.&amp;#160;
        Anecdotally, Rachel has seen this program provide a positive impact. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, this novel program seems to me to be a unique way to approach a very
        difficult problem.&amp;#160; It reduces the cost to the taxpayers and provides a safe
        place for these individuals.&amp;#160; Obviously we would all like to see these problems
        solved, but, failing that, at least the county is trying to manage it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
