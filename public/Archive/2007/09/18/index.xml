    &lt;p&gt;
        I haven&#39;t updated my blog in forever and I&#39;m probably going to abandon my homebrew
        static client generated site for something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://mephistoblog.com/&#34;&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; at
        some point but I haven&#39;t had time to make the transition. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In the meantime, I&#39;d like to save people some pain and document the steps I have go
        through to upgrade my Highpoint RocketRaid 2220 on Linux.&amp;#160; I installed the driver
        a while ago and don&#39;t remember the exact steps for that, so this is just what I do
        to upgrade.&amp;#160; I wrote a little shell script: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;#! /bin/sh -v

# Update this version every time you upgrade.
VER=2.6.15-29-686

# To update the highpoint driver:
# 1) Download latest highpoint driver from: 
#
# http://www.highpoint-tech.com/BIOS_Driver/rr222x/Linux/
#
# 2) Patch driver by changing wrong kernel #ifdefs in osm/linux/os_linux.c  
#   KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,15) -&amp;gt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,16)

# Disable sata_mv.ko by moving it to a new directory.  This driver
# conflicts with highpoint driver.  I don&#39;t know if this is the
# &#34;right&#34; way to do this, but it works.
sudo mkdir -p /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled
sudo mv /lib/modules/${VER}/kernel/drivers/scsi/sata_mv.ko /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled/

# Make sure kernel headers are installed
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-${VER}

# Make new hpt driver:
cd ~jbeda/sources/rr222x-linux-src-1.07/product/rr2220/linux/
make KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build
sudo make install KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build

# make a new ramfs
# mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-27-686 /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-686
sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-${VER}&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Good luck. I hope this helps people out there that are stuck with this thing. I&#39;m
        still looking for a good cheap solution to host lots of SATA drives on Linux.&amp;#160;
        Port multipliers are there and aren&#39;t as cheap as they should be.&amp;#160; The driver
        situation is pretty dire and there aren&#39;t that many non RAID (fake or not) &amp;gt;4 ports
        out there.&amp;#160; I haven&#39;t tried any SAS cards though -- perhaps the situation there
        is better.&amp;#160; I&#39;m also running an LSI MegaRAID SATA 300-8XLP with the megaraid
        driver.&amp;#160; It wasn&#39;t as cheap but at least it works with a true open driver.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
