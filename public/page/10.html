    <p>
        Raymond, ever the source of interesting info, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/24/140283.aspx">details</a> how
        to extend the context menu in IE.&#160; This was the first feature that I coded up
        at MS after I joined back in 97.&#160; This came in late in the IE4 product cycle.&#160;
        It is cool to see that it still comes up once in a while.&#160; The original idea
        was to allow a dictionary program to let you right click on a word to get a definition.&#160;
        It turns out to be much more powerful than that.

        My <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/18.html#a185">entry</a> pointing
        to our WinHEC slides resulted in links from quite a few sites and a ton of hits.&#160;
        Top among these was an article on <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/05/23/1737226.shtml?tid=109&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=190&amp;tid=201">Slashdot</a>.&#160;
        Also notable are links from <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=7134">OSNews</a>&#160;and <a href="http://www.joeuser.com/index.asp?AID=16309&amp;u=0">Brad
        Wardell (joeuser.com)</a>.&#160; In the last year my blog has gotten 20k hits (not
        counting RSS reads).&#160; In the last day it has gotten something like 25k hits.&#160;
        I'm sure that most of those 25k people won't be back to read this entry, but I'll
        respond anyway. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I appreciate the attention and I've been trying to keep up with all of the comments.&#160;
        Here are some notes and responses: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First off, I can't answer every question.&#160; I have no desire to get in to a flame
            war over specific details or comparisons. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232376">Avalon's
            relationship to Direct3D</a>:&#160; I tried to make this clear in the slides, but
            it is worth repeating.&#160; We are building a managed presentation and UI layer on
            top of Direct3D.&#160; While we will be exposing a 3D API, it is meant to round out
            the UI story and integrate well with our 2D API.&#160; If you are doing super complex
            3D stuff (FPS games), or want access to the latest and greatest Direct3D features,
            Direct3D is the way to go.&#160; If you want to mix a little 3D in with your 2D, Avalon's
            3D APIs will let you do that in a painless way. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232430">Do
            we really need the eye candy?</a>: This has been a popular topic ever since we started
            planning and talking about Avalon.&#160; I'm planning on posting something on this
            later to start the discussion.&#160; My short take: I think that providing more capability
            in the platform is a good thing that will make Windows a more attractive place to
            write applications.&#160; I think that it will also allow our stock user experience
            (Aero and the shell team) and application developers to push the limits and interact
            with users in fundamentally better ways.&#160; However, with power comes responsibility.&#160;
            We are working on a set of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/ux/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaero/html/samplerintro.asp">guidelines</a> (these
            are the Aero user interface guidelines) to help application authors use this stuff
            in a consistent way. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232485">The
            3D bar graph demo is useless</a>: I admit, this <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/06.html#a182">example</a> is
            useless as is.&#160; In a <em>real</em> application there will be a lot more UI about
            picking what data you want to look at and how you want to look at it.&#160; The position
            and view of the 3D graph would probably be controlled by the mouse so that you can
            rotate things around to see hidden data.&#160; There would probably be different types
            of graphs that you would switch between.&#160; However, this was meant as a demo application
            that we threw together in a couple of days.&#160; While the application is a demo,
            the platform that it is running on is real.&#160; There should be nothing stopping
            someone from building a more industrial strength really usable version of this. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232540">We
            are behind the ball on 64 bit</a>:&#160; While Windows had been compiling and shipping
            (well, in beta to be clear) on 64 bit for quite a while (we handed out ia64 and x64
            versions of Longhorn at WinHEC and via MSDN) the real call to action here was to IHVs.&#160;
            Remember this&#160;was the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference.&#160; IHVs have
            limited resources wrt writing drivers and we want to encourage them to write and maintain
            64 bit drivers.&#160; This was one of the big pushes for the conference as a whole.&#160;
            We don't want 64 bit uptake to be slowed down by lack of driver support. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232633">The
            longhorn requirements are crazy</a>: I don't know where the requirements listed here
            came from, but I haven't seen that list.&#160; Obviously we won't see that on a laptop!&#160;
            There are a couple of things to note here.&#160; 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, we will run in software and on lower end machines.&#160; Things may run slower,
                    but it will run.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second, we are going to offer multiple experiences based on hardware capabilities
                    and user preferences.&#160; This ranges from a classic view, to Aero to Aero Glass.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third, the current minimum requirement for Aero Glass is a DX9 class card with 64MB
                    of video memory.&#160; More video memory will be required for higher resolutions or
                    multiple monitors.&#160; We also require the GPU to support PS 2.0 and have a LDDM
                    (Longhorn Device Driver Model) driver. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fourth, as for processor requirements, most of the time when we have, in the past,
                    required a certain speed processor it has been because that speed has been an indicator
                    of the rest of the components in the machine (bus speed, hard driver speed, memory
                    speed, processor instruction support, etc.)&#160; The idea has been to use that one
                    number&#160;as a <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">heuristic </span>for
                    the "generation" of the machine.&#160; Hell, I've run Win2k3 server on a 400MHz celeron.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, we <em>are</em> really concerned about battery life and are working hard to
                    come up with a scalable user experience for times when battery life is more important
                    than running the GPU at full throttle.&#160; I believe that there are a bunch of slides
                    in Kerry's talk on that. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            (my favorite) <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9233103">"dipshits
            still can't code html/css?"</a>: I never claimed to be an artist, but the CSS in question
            was my attempt to get a little bit funky with the style of my site.&#160; It is on
            purpose.&#160; I assume that it will work in most browsers but, honestly, I only tested
            it with IE and Pocket IE.&#160; I posted a <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=201&amp;mode=thread&amp;pid=9233844#9234182">response</a> to
            this on slashdot but apparently someone <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=201&amp;mode=thread&amp;pid=9234182#9235628">thought
            I wasn't me</a>.&#160; Too funny! 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9235276">The
            whole Apple transparent window thing</a>:&#160; I don't read or comment on patents.&#160;
            However, transparent windows have been around for quite a while.&#160; In the windows
            world, these things were introduced in W2K with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwui/html/layerwin.asp">layered
            window support</a>.&#160; Other OSs may have had something similar earlier. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=7134&amp;offset=15&amp;rows=30#239957">Longhorn
            is just vaporware.</a>&#160; <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=109&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=190&amp;tid=201&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=9232324">I'll
            believe it when it ships in 2017</a>:&#160; I'm not crazy enough to comment on ship
            dates.&#160; I'll leave that to the PR people and the execs.&#160; However, we are
            showing off real code.&#160; We've publicly shipped two builds of Longhorn (the PDC
            and the recent WinHEC build) along with SDKs.&#160; Not everything is done yet and
            it is rough around the edges, but this isn't just slideware. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=7134#239905">Innovation</a>:&#160;
            Innovation is such a loaded word.&#160; Hell, MS probably did more to make it loaded
            than anyone else :).&#160; However, I never used the word on my blog and I don't know
            where the guy who posted this to OSNews.com got it.&#160; It really touched off a
            flamewar there which basically comes down to your definition of innovation.&#160;
            Leaving that aside...&#160; I think that Avalon, and Longhorn in general, puts a lot
            of very interesting features together in an integrated API that will benefit developers
            and end users in very exciting ways.&#160; Use your own definition of innovative to
            parse that last sentence. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Well, hopefully that runs the gamut.&#160; I probably missed some stuff, but I have
        to get some real work done today.

        While reading these slides, keep in mind that we were targeting hardware people.&#160;
        This was really about letting IHVs know what they can do to prepare for what is coming
        in Longhorn and Avalon.

    <p>
        Ha! I get linked from a <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=106586&amp;cid=9070786">comment</a> and
        I see a spike in traffic.&#160; Slashdot is <em>the</em> flow machine.&#160; In any
        case, there are some misstatements in that comment that I'd like to answer.&#160;
        First, I'm not "the guy from Microsoft behind Avalon."&#160; Rather I'm one on a large
        team of developers.&#160; My particular area is the graphics APIs.&#160; Avalon is
        much more than just graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, managed code is a different beast that unmanaged code.&#160; While it can
        make programmers more productive and I totally think that it is the way of the future,
        a developer can write bad code in any language.&#160; While right now I don't think
        that anyone would claim that managed code is faster than unmanaged code, the difference
        is generally not that great.&#160; I've heard of some research that suggests that
        future JITs may be able to apply run time directed optimizations and recompilation
        that <em>could</em> make managed code faster.&#160; But that world isn't here yet.

        I'm done with my part of helping make WinHEC a success.&#160; My talk went off pretty
        well and we got some great questions and comments.&#160; I also worked the booth and
        showed&#160;industry and press people what Longhorn can do.&#160; The big news for
        the WinHEC release is that we now have a start to our 3D APIs.&#160; We had a couple
        of examples that show mixing 3D and 2D in a seamless way.&#160; I tried to go out
        of my way to make sure that everyone knew that Avalon was much more than just graphics.&#160;
        We are a full UI platoform that includes controls, styling, databinding, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main demo I was showing was a simulated "blood sugar tracker."&#160; It essentially
        has a 3D bar graph in the background that slowly rotates.&#160; Layered on that are
        semi-transparent buttons.&#160; There is also a details panel that can come up that
        is semi-transparent and has another 3D scene hosted inside of it.&#160; We have a
        vector graphic doctor icon in the corner that you can zoom in on to see that it is
        rasterized at the device resolution.&#160; The really impressive thing here is that
        our demo team (a dev and a designer) took 2-3 days to turn this from an email idea
        into reality.&#160; Robert and <a href="http://longhornblogs.com/ndunlap/">Nathan</a> did
        a great job of showing the power of Avalon.&#160; Here is a screen shot:

        I should have posted this earlier, but better late than never.&#160; I'm going to
        be speaking at WinHEC.&#160; It'll be session TW04006: Avalon Graphics - 2D, 3D, Imaging
        and Composition.&#160; If you are there and are interested in Avalon come check it
        out.&#160; I'll be going in to some detail on what happens between when a developer
        calls an API and we call Direct3D.&#160;&#160;If you aren't going to be there, wish
        me luck.&#160; The room holds 700 people (I think) and I've never talked in front
        of that many people before.

    <p>
        I'll also be hanging out in the tech lounge and be at our "Ask the Experts" session.

        </h2>

    <p>
        Here in Windows (and in other groups around the company) we have a system that is
        generally called stress.&#160; Different groups have different implementations, but
        the idea is always the same.&#160; You develop a test suite that hammers you system
        and&#160;then have everyone install it and run it overnight.&#160; The idea is that
        this way we can catch those hard to repro issues that only our customers see. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When you get one of these errors, what do you do with it?&#160; Generally there is
        a team of people who have the thankless job of coming in early, finding all the machines
        that have broken in to the debugger, logging the failures in a database and having
        the system send mail to various people to investigate.&#160; The actual debugging
        is done via the NT command line debugger (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/ddk/debugging/default.mspx">cdb</a>)
        redirected over the network via the remote.exe utility.&#160; It is up to this team
        to figure out which issues have already been caught and fixed (but perhaps aren't
        in the build yet) and what issues are new and need to be investigated.&#160; These
        guys cover a lot of code so the generally don't have the knowledge to figure out what
        developer should be looking at any particular problem.&#160; That falls to the rotating
        list of people who are on "stress duty."&#160; The shell team calls it "dev of the
        day."&#160; We've learned by hard experience that if you send these types of things
        to a big mailing list, they either get ignored or the same sorry glutton for punishment
        picks up all of the issues. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I happen to be on stress duty this week.&#160; My job is to handle, in as expedient
        a fashion as possible, any incoming issues.&#160;&#160;I&#160;have to do my best to
        exercise&#160;my debugging skills and try to figure out what is going on.&#160; BTW, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond
        Chen</a> is one of the undisputed masters of the cdb kung-fu.&#160; If I can figure
        out what is going on myself, I can file a bug on the issue and let the person whose
        machine I'm debugging reclaim their machine.&#160; If the problem is in code that
        I don't know well it is my job to reassign the issue to someone who does know the
        code well.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond handling incoming stress breaks in the morning, I also have to be responsive
        to all sorts of other issues that might get dropped on the floor.&#160; This includes
        other random crashes people might have during the day along with helping out to resolve
        any build breaks.&#160; (We try super hard to make sure that build breaks don't happen,
        but with something the size of Windows it still sometimes happens.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Do other companies have systems like this set up?&#160; I'd be interested to hear
        what works for you.

        question</a> about the history of how my team in Avalon decide to split our component
        between managed and unmanaged code.
