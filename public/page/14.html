        I'm sure everyone has seen this now, but <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/10.html">Joel
        is dead on</a> wrt Unicode.&#160; I worked on some of the codepage reloading stuff
        in IE so I've lived some of this stuff -- Both recognizing the BOM for Unicode and
        implementing the reload of an already started page when we hit the codepage meta.&#160;
        Most of IE is fully unicode of course.&#160; The only exception is when we deal with
        URLs because, back in the day, they were restricted to 7bit ascii. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some other issues that Joel didn't bring up that devs should be aware of: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sorting unicode is hard.&#160; Each language has its own sort rules.&#160; Given any
            particular set of strings, they may be sorted differently depending on the language. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Capitilization can be hard also.&#160; There was a bug in IE at one point where we
            didn't deal with capitilization of a japanese string right and someone's name was
            transformed into "dead body on beach."&#160; At the very least that is a rude thing
            to call someone. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Be aware that text that looks the same on the screen can be backed by different unicode
            codepoints.&#160; This is a problem with going to unicode for URLs as it makes domain
            squating more difficult to deal with.&#160; Two people might own two domains that
            look the same when typed in but are instead actually two different domains from a
            unicode codepoint point of view.&#160; As an analogy, I was looking at an ancient
            typewriter the other day that one of our PMs has outside of her office.&#160; It doesn't
            have a '1' key!&#160; The solution is to just use the 'l' (L) key instead.&#160; Now
            imagine if the keys are font glyphs as displayed on the screen and the concept of
            '1' and 'l' are unicode codepoints.&#160; 'He11o' and 'Hello' would look exactly alike
            on the screen but would actually be different domains.</li>
    </ul>

        The reason I haven't been posting is that I've been setting up a new computer here
        at home.&#160; I got rid of my 1.4GHz Athlon and replaced it with a sweet 2.8GHz P4.&#160;
        The 800MHz memory interface along with a new <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/index.php?LT=english&amp;Language_s=2&amp;url_place=product&amp;p_serial=TAC-T01&amp;other_title=+TAC-T01+Wave%20Master">case</a>&#160;and
        mirrored RAID 120GB SATA drives make this a sweet ride.&#160; The main reason that
        I upgraded is that I've been taking a ton of photos and I haven't been as diligent
        at backing them up as I should be.&#160; The mirrored drives are an extra level of
        insurance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus, blue LEDs just look sweet.&#160; Now all I need is a big tailpipe and "Powered
        by HKS" stickers! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't picked a new videocard yet.&#160; But when I do, I'm going to get the most
        powerful thing that I can afford.&#160; Come to the PDC and you'll see what I've been
        working on and why!

        At the party I've come up with a law.&#160; You heard it here first: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>"If I can write&#160;80% of a piece of software in a weekend, there is no
        business model for that software."</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        I fundamentally believe that there is no money to be made by selling people blogging
        tools (like Radio).&#160; They are just too easy to write.&#160; Providing a hosting/blogging/etc.
        service is another thing entirely.

    My guinea pig died yesterday.&#160; We got home from our trip and picked her up from
    the friend that was taking care of her.&#160; She was old (almost 7!) and it was probably
    just her time.&#160; Rachel and I like to think that she waited until we got back
    to give up.&#160; We spent all yesterday crying and dealing with it.&#160; I know
    that it seems silly to cry over a guinea pig, but she was a very sweet pet and we
    loved her.

        I'm back from vacation and catching up.&#160;&#160;We picked up a new car at the factory

        So I saw the news items about the new security issues in Office and went to update
        my home install via <a href="http://www.officeupdate.com/ProductUpdates/default.aspx">office
        update</a>.&#160; Unfortunately&#160;you need office SP2 to install the patches and
        you need your original install media to install SP2.&#160; I just moved.&#160; I have
        no idea where the original media is.&#160; How many people&#160;out there are in the
        same boat?&#160; What if someone (gasp) pirated their copy of Office?&#160;&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        Requiring original media to install security updates seems like a bad plan to me.&#160;

    Well, it turns out that in my new house I can only get 256kbs up and 256kbs down.&#160;
    In the old place I was getting 640kbs up and 256kbs down.&#160; I guess I'm just too
    far from the CO.&#160; My choices are to (a) suck it up, (b) go with a cable modem
    and their onerous terms of service or (c) shell out big bucks for a business class
    line.&#160; So far (a) is looking good but I'm not happy about it.
