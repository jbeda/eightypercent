    <p>
        This afternoon I went to some meetings on how to present yourself as a Microsoft employee
        for the PDC.&#160; It was mostly predictable -- use common sense when talking to customers,
        don't badmouth competitors and be careful around the press.&#160; However, one thing
        that stuck out in my mind is the fact that we are now encouranged to hand out our
        business cards.&#160; In the past, it was considered a virtue to keep the development
        team from getting "distracted" by direction interaction with customers.&#160; I like
        this new approach a lot more.

    I know I'm late to the party here, but I finially <a href="http://pdcbloggers.net/Bloggers/Staff/Joe_Beda.category">signed
    up</a> to get my site listed on PDCBloggers.com.&#160; I'm super jazzed about the

    <p>
        I made the cut and I'm going to be going to the PDC.&#160; Here is the where and when
        of where I'm going to be for sure: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I will be proctoring some of the client "Hands On Labs."&#160; I'll be working Monday,
            Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm going to be an Expert at the "Ask the Experts" event on Tuesday night.&#160; I
            don't remember the exact name of the table/room we'll be in, but look for the closest
            thing to Avalon client graphics. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'll be cheering Greg Schechter on as he presents an in depth intro to Avalon graphics
            at the CLI341 breakout on Tuesday afternoon (3:45-5:00). 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm not scheduled to officially man the Avalon booth, but I'll probably be hanging
            out there some of the time. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Anything else you guys think I should hit?&#160; Some of the "Birds of a Feather"
        sessions look like fun.&#160; The one titled: "Strategic Decisions and Rich Client
        War Stories: Designing today for "Whidbey" and "Longhorn"" looks good along with the
        "VS.NET Secret Tips &amp; Tricks" session.&#160; "What is Windows in an HD World?"
        looks like fun too! 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to get ahold of me during the PDC, post a comment to something up here
        or send email to "pdc at bedafamily.com" and we'll figure out a way to meet.

    <p>
        I'm sure everyone has seen this now, but <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/10.html">Joel
        is dead on</a> wrt Unicode.&#160; I worked on some of the codepage reloading stuff
        in IE so I've lived some of this stuff -- Both recognizing the BOM for Unicode and
        implementing the reload of an already started page when we hit the codepage meta.&#160;
        Most of IE is fully unicode of course.&#160; The only exception is when we deal with
        URLs because, back in the day, they were restricted to 7bit ascii. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some other issues that Joel didn't bring up that devs should be aware of: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sorting unicode is hard.&#160; Each language has its own sort rules.&#160; Given any
            particular set of strings, they may be sorted differently depending on the language. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Capitilization can be hard also.&#160; There was a bug in IE at one point where we
            didn't deal with capitilization of a japanese string right and someone's name was
            transformed into "dead body on beach."&#160; At the very least that is a rude thing
            to call someone. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Be aware that text that looks the same on the screen can be backed by different unicode
            codepoints.&#160; This is a problem with going to unicode for URLs as it makes domain
            squating more difficult to deal with.&#160; Two people might own two domains that
            look the same when typed in but are instead actually two different domains from a
            unicode codepoint point of view.&#160; As an analogy, I was looking at an ancient
            typewriter the other day that one of our PMs has outside of her office.&#160; It doesn't
            have a '1' key!&#160; The solution is to just use the 'l' (L) key instead.&#160; Now
            imagine if the keys are font glyphs as displayed on the screen and the concept of
            '1' and 'l' are unicode codepoints.&#160; 'He11o' and 'Hello' would look exactly alike
            on the screen but would actually be different domains.</li>
    </ul>

        The reason I haven't been posting is that I've been setting up a new computer here
        at home.&#160; I got rid of my 1.4GHz Athlon and replaced it with a sweet 2.8GHz P4.&#160;
        The 800MHz memory interface along with a new <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/index.php?LT=english&amp;Language_s=2&amp;url_place=product&amp;p_serial=TAC-T01&amp;other_title=+TAC-T01+Wave%20Master">case</a>&#160;and
        mirrored RAID 120GB SATA drives make this a sweet ride.&#160; The main reason that
        I upgraded is that I've been taking a ton of photos and I haven't been as diligent
        at backing them up as I should be.&#160; The mirrored drives are an extra level of
        insurance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus, blue LEDs just look sweet.&#160; Now all I need is a big tailpipe and "Powered
        by HKS" stickers! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't picked a new videocard yet.&#160; But when I do, I'm going to get the most
        powerful thing that I can afford.&#160; Come to the PDC and you'll see what I've been
        working on and why!

        At the party I've come up with a law.&#160; You heard it here first: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>"If I can write&#160;80% of a piece of software in a weekend, there is no
        business model for that software."</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        I fundamentally believe that there is no money to be made by selling people blogging
        tools (like Radio).&#160; They are just too easy to write.&#160; Providing a hosting/blogging/etc.
        service is another thing entirely.

    My guinea pig died yesterday.&#160; We got home from our trip and picked her up from
    the friend that was taking care of her.&#160; She was old (almost 7!) and it was probably
    just her time.&#160; Rachel and I like to think that she waited until we got back
    to give up.&#160; We spent all yesterday crying and dealing with it.&#160; I know
    that it seems silly to cry over a guinea pig, but she was a very sweet pet and we
    loved her.
