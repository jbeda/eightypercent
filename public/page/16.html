        When we are designing APIs, we think about this type of thing.&#160; We want to make
        it easier for the "bad programmer" to write code that isn't so bad.&#160; However,
        you can only do so much.

        I finally signed up at Haloscan and now have comments up here.&#160; I don't know

    <p>
        After the first outage at Haloscan, I'll probably give up and write my own comment
        system.&#160; I want to keep it seperate from JoeBlogger though so that JoeBlogger
        is still a client render/FTP too.&#160; The comment system will probably be similar
        to Haloscan in the way it is hosted on a page.

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/06/26.html">Earlier</a>, I was
        wondering if the new G5 Macs would have an OS that could take advantage of their 64
        bit nature, or if Apple was going to take a short cut and run the G5 in a compat mode.&#160;
        Apparently, that <em>is</em> going to be the case, at least according to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/31995.html">this
        Register article</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a lot of ways, this is just more hype from Apple.&#160; Many Intel processesors
        (I don't know the exact ones) actually have a 36 bit addressing bus.&#160; Those extra
        4 bits mean that the processor can actually address 16 times as much memory as a 32
        bit addressing bus.&#160; The difference is between 4GB and 64GB.&#160; However, most
        Windows machines don't take advantage of that extra capacity.&#160; The APIs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp?frame=true">are
        there</a> though, if you want to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, is the 64 bit nature of the G5 hype?&#160; As far as I can tell, right now the
        answer is yes.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Well, I'm sure that someone will port 64 bit Linux to it, and that will be cool.&#160;
        It might become the cheapest way to get a 64 bit linux machine, if AMD doesn't beat
        them to the punch)

        Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/23.html#a3879">linked to
        me</a>.&#160; Thanks dude!
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I'm not a PM.&#160; I'm a Dev Lead.&#160; I don't know if everyone knows
        the break down of different jobs at Microsoft, but, in the technical areas, there
        are three main jobs: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/programmanagement.aspx">Program
        Management</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaredevelopment.aspx">Development</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaretesting.aspx">Test</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The breakdown goes like this:&#160; PMs talk to customers, develop requirements and
        write specs, Devs implement the code to those specs and Test validates that the Devs
        did their job.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, things never work out that cleanly.&#160; For example, the Test team are
        some of the people first using the product so they may have more and better feedback
        than just if the program works.&#160; And in a techinical area, like what I'm working
        on (graphics and APIs), a lot of the design work can be done by devs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft is trying to develop higher level individual contributer developers to help
        lead the architecture of the product.&#160; I'm heading down that track right now.&#160; <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> is
        another example of this.&#160; Part of this is that just because you are good at writing
        code doesn't mean that you are good at managing people.&#160; Beyond that, it is <em>really</em> hard
        to find PMs that can operate at the technical level necessary for some groups -- such
        as designing windows APIs.&#160; As a result of this, higher level individual contributer
        devs and technical PMs do many of the same jobs.&#160; This is why I've spent that
        last year or so writing specs!

    <p>
        The house stuff is winding down.&#160; We close on August 18th, and I think that we
        are mostly on cruise control until then.&#160; We needed the owners to put a new roof
        on the house, so there was quite a bit of back and forth on that.&#160; I think we
        have it worked out now!
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, this last weekend I went to my <a href="http://www.imsa93.org/">10 year
        high school</a> reunion.&#160; It was a blast!&#160; I should put some pictures up...
    </p>
    <p>
        (The reasons that I don't post any pictures is that I want to make JoeBlogger have
        a picture gallery mode and I haven't gotten around to coding it up yet.&#160; I should
        really get off my ass and do it.)

    <p>
        I'm back in Seattle for good!&#160; Yay! 
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of that, Rachel and I took this week off to move and buy a house.&#160; We've
        made an offer and they have accepted!&#160; The inspection is on Sunday and we are
        figuring out mortgage and insurance stuff.&#160; The house is in the <a href="http://montlake.net/montlake.asp">Montlake</a> neighborhood
        of Seattle.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The house is withing walking distance to the University hospital so, Rachel can walk
        to work most of the time.&#160; The rest of the time there are free shuttles that
        run from the U hospital to the other hospitals around Seattle.&#160; The house is
        also close enough to the freeway bus stop so I can stop sitting in my car and start
        sitting in a bus.&#160; Microsoft has a really good bus commuter program where anyone
        can get a free bus pass. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, in <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">great historic tradition</a>&#160;I may
        get busy with the house, the move and work and I may not be posting much.

    <p>
        Just wondering, but does anyone know if Mac OS X actually allows processes to run
        with a full 64 bit address space?&#160; Or is everything just running in a 32 bit
        compat mode?&#160; I couldn't see anything with a quick search on Apple's web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        WinNT ran on the 64 bit alpha quite a while ago, but it only ran in a 32 bit mode.&#160;
        Is Apple doing the same thing here?&#160; Is the whole 64 bit thing, wrt Apple, all
        flash and no fire?
    </p>
    <p>
        BTW, just because the&#160;new&#160;G5 machines&#160;can have 8GB of RAM doesn't mean
        that an <em>individual</em> process can access more than 4GB.&#160; Hell,&#160;some
        Intel procs&#160;can access &gt;4Gb, but they are still 32 bit processors.&#160; For
        example, the 32 bit version of W2k3 server can support 32GB of RAM.&#160; This extra
        RAM can be accessed via specialized APIs or you can have, for example, 10 processes
        each using 2GB.

    <p>
        I've released a new version of JoeBlogger based on feedback from <a href="http://www.neelbubba.com">Bubba</a> and <a href="http://devhawk.net/">Harry</a>.&#160;
        I've also fixed a few problems that I've found.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-0.9.1.msi">msi</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-src-0.9.1.zip">src</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/Readme-0.9.1.txt">readme</a> and <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/License.txt">license</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed data loss issues when hitting "New Entry" button while current entry hasn't
            been uploaded.</li>
        <li>
            Fixed FTP issues with multi-line responses from FTP server.</li>
        <li>
            Added a "FilePutDelay" parameter to the site1.config file for dealing with FTP servers
            that get confused if you move too fast.&#160; This is in milliseconds.&#160; 1000
            seems to solve most problems.</li>
        <li>
            Moved some code around and had to put a custom binder in the upstreamer deserialization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There aren't any big new features yet.&#160; I just haven't had time.&#160; However,
        when the new system goes up at gotdotnet.com, I'll probably start a workspace over
        there.&#160; I haven't done it already because the current source control system that
        comes with the workspaces is really really bad.
