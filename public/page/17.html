        I'm packing up to move back to Seattle, so don't expect a lot of posting over the
        next week.

        Telecommuting was fun, but I'm really feeling out of the loop at work.&#160; I miss
        my friends and living in a big(ger) city.&#160; I'm looking forward to everything
        except the real commute across 520 every day.&#160; Oh well, I guess you have to take
        the good with the bad.

    <p>
        I freakin' hate ticketmaster.&#160; I just had to buy a baseball ticket -- just one
        as we have another person going to the game.&#160; The base ticket price is $16 but
        the total ended up being $22.81.&#160; That is a 43% service charge.&#160; That is
        more than I pay in income tax. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond this, I had to actually use the phone instead of doing it online because I
        wanted to get a seat as close to my other tickets.&#160; In addition to ripping me
        off they: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Asked for my email address to send me confirmation and then asked me if it is okay
            to sign me up to some random&#160;spam list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to sports illustrated. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to entertainment weekly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to entice me to some other offer that I didn't catch because the poor guy in
            their phone center was mumbling. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Selling tickets can't be that hard a business to run.&#160; Are these guys just money
        hungry?

        I got some email from someone who calls himself "RAD Moose" (blogs offline...) on
        an easier way to take a snapshot from a video file.&#160; This might come in handly
        later.&#160; Here it is: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Open WindowsMovieMaker2 (feature not in WMM1) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Import Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll thru movie in Preview Window 
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "Take Picture From Preview Window" item in Tools Menu 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Very cool!&#160; I'll have to download Movie Maker 2 and give this a try!

        I just don't get the excitement around 802.11a and 802.11g standards.&#160; Sure --
        5 times as fast would be nice, but in reality, I'm not using my wireless connection
        for anything that requires faster speeds.&#160; God knows my broadband connection
        can't keep up with 11Mbps.&#160; And if I do (like copying GBs of photos around) I
        just plug in to an ethernet cable. I know, eventually we'll get video on demand and
        all sorts of other high end services over these wireless links.
    </p>
    <p>
        802.11b strikes a great balance of speed and range.&#160; The build-out is happening.&#160;
        Why is the press trying to make such a big deal of it?&#160; Or is it not the press
        and there are people who are&#160;really excited about this stuff?
    </p>
    <p>
        (10Gb ethernet might be more interesting as this means the network is approaching
        bus speeds.)

        I was busting a gut on this.&#160; They even say "Moo" at the end.

    <p>
        (Getting that snapshot of the video was a total PITA.&#160; Because of video overlays,
        PrintScreen didn't work.&#160; I had to turn off all of the video acceleration features
        via the display control panel so that the video went through the normal display pipeline.&#160;
        Overlays suck -- and they don't work with a desktop compositor.&#160; <em>Hint, hint</em>.)

        I've been working on buying a new car recently.&#160; I'm going to buy a BMW Z4.&#160;
        As part of this I've started learning as much as I can so that I pick the right options
        (and the right car!) and get a good deal.&#160; As part of this I've been reading
        the <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/">online forums</a> up at roadfly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        BMW seems to have great customer service!&#160; Check out <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3341488&amp;page=1">this</a> thread.&#160;
        This guy is having problems with the SMG transmission on his car.&#160; (SMG is "Sequential
        Manual Gearbox" and is similar to an F1 race car transmission)&#160; Notice <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3350545&amp;page=1">this</a> response
        from a BMW customer service rep. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish that we could give this type of support for Windows.&#160; Perhaps if we charged
        $40k a copy we could :)

        If it isn't apparent from other sources, I work for Microsoft.&#160; Obviously, I
        cant speak for the company, but I'd like to draw attention to some comments from Steve
        Ballmer in the recent memo that he sent to us.&#160; <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> has
        these comments <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/05.html#a3206">posted</a> on
        his blog and I don't want to see them get lost in the shuffle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SteveB wrote: "Many customers, MVP's, employees, and industry analysts have said to
        us that people would appreciate our innovations more and the value we deliver if they
        knew the company and its people better." and&#160; "To generate enthusiasm for our
        company and innovations, we must also communicate more broadly and in a more human
        and compelling voice." 
    </p>
    <p>
        In case you haven't noticed, this blog (and many others) are a grassroots effort from
        within the company to do just what Steve is asking.&#160; What would you like to see?&#160;
        How do you think that we can execute on this mission of transparency? 
    </p>
    <p>
        In my opinion, we have a long road ahead to dig ourselves out of the hole that we've
        dug.&#160; Engaging with the community in a real way is one step.
