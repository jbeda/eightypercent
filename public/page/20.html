    <p>
        Version 0.9.0 of my upstreamer is released. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Download the MSI installer <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/FTPUpstreamer-0.9.0.msi">here</a>.
        The source is available <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/FTPUpstreamer-0.9.0.zip">here</a>.
        The license for both is a zlib type license. You can read it <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/License.txt">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Notes about the release: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            FTPUpstreamer is a utility to upload a local directory to a remote directory on an
            FTP server. It keeps track of the files that have been uploaded already and the last
            changed time on those files. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This is a beta release. Don't expect too much. I've only really tested this against
            one server (W2k3, I think). I've only tested the client on XP Pro. 
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no support for listing or deleting files on the server. If you want to do
            more sophisticated stuff you might want to check out a more fully featured FTP program.
            I've used <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">SmartFTP</a> and it has worked well for
            me. 
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no support for automatic uploading yet. You have to hit the button. At some
            point I'll have it automatically scan for changes. I'll also make it minimize to a
            tray icon. I figured getting something out early is best. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The program requires the .Net framework v1.0. You can get this from Windows Update. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Your FTP password is stored in plain text.</b> The config file is something like
            "c:\Documents and Settings\Joe\Local Settings\Application Data\FTPUploadConfig.xml".
            I don't think the uninstaller removes this. There are some other data files in the
            same directory that will also not be removed. Buyer beware. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you have any problems go ahead and write me email at FTPUpstreamer at BedaFamily.com.
        If I'm not super responsive (I have a day job) you can always update the source yourself.
        If you send me deltas I'll try to integrate them. At some point I may put the source
        under some sort of project management like GotDotNet workspaces or Sourceforge.

<p>I think I'm going to evolve my blogging software some more over the next couple of weeks.  I want to add the following features:
<ul>
<li>True WYSIWYG HTML editing.  I'm still writing HTML directly.  I think that I'm going to steal whatever Chris has in BlogX.
<li>Stories.  I want to be able to easily do one-off pages.
<li>Content macro expansion.  I want to be able to name a page or an entry and have a friendly way to refer to it.  Radio does this (I think) by just looking at words in quotes.  I may do the same.
<li>Photo gallery.  Ideally I'd like to be able to dump a bunch of files in a directory and have it create thumbnails and generate gallery pages.  I'd also want a UI for dealing with this stuff:  Ordering files, adding descriptions, etc.  I've been using <a href="http://www.pbase.com">PBase</a> for a while now but I think I want a better client side UI.
</ul>
<p>Right now the UI for JoeBlogger is dead simple.  There is no "save" button.  Just a "New Entry" and an "Upload" button.  There is a calendar control for finding entries and a list for all of the entries for that day.  My goal is to keep it that simple as I add these new features.
<p>BTW, I still plan on finishing the stand alone FTP uploader first!

<p>Here is a panorama from Dante's View in Death Valley.  We made it up there for this spectacular sunset.  This is a stich of 6 images shot with my 20mm f/2.8 lens on my D60.  It has a horizontal FOV of somewhere around 120 degrees.  Since this is a rectilinear projection, it is equivalent to shooting with a rectilinear 4mm lens.

<p>I'm back from my photo trip to Death Valley.  I had a great time, got some great images and met some really interesting people.  I'll put up some of the images tonight after I finish wading through email at work!
<p>Since we woke up before sunrise every day (~4-5am) and stayed out after sunrise followed by dinner I didn't get much sleep.  I'm tired but also recharged.

<p>I'm still working on my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/03/11.html#a66">FTP upstreamer</a> app.  I haven't had as much time as I'd have liked to work on it but it is still coming.  The backend code is all there but I haven't had the time to learn enough winforms to write a decent UI for it.  If you really want to look at the code (and itegrate it into your own project?) let me know and I'll send you something.  I'm release the code under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php">zlib</a> license like Chris did for BlogX.

<p>If you do write me, I probably won't get to it until next week as I'm going to be down in Death Valley for a <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/02/18.html#a39">photography</a> <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com/workshops/sk-dv-work.shtml">workshop</a>.

    <p>
        Earlier tonight (I guess it is last night now...) I went and took a bunch of photos
        of the Idaho State Capital building here in Boise. I stitched these together using <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm">PTAssembler</a> (by
        Max Lyons) and <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/pano12ml.htm">PanoTools</a> (originally
        by <a href="http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/~dersch/">Helmut Dersch</a>). I think it came
        out pretty good for a first try. I think it would have come out better with a real
        pano tripod head instead of me just winging it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The full size image is around 11 megapixels. Each of those pixels is pretty sharp
        though. It has an amazing amount of detail:<br />
        <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/Boise Cap Small.jpg"><img src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/Boise Cap Thumb.jpg" /></a> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a small 100% crop from the center of the frame to give you an idea of scale:<br />
        <img src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/Boise Cap Crop.jpg" /> 
    </p>
    <p>
        [4/10/2004] I've realized that Capital should be Capitol, but you'd be surprised how
        many hits I get from the google search engine based on the misspelling.&#160; Oh well,
        I think I'll leave it wrong.
