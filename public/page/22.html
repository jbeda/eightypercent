MichaelW <i>does</i> have an RSS feed -- he just makes it really hard to find:<br>
<a href="http://michaelw.net/Articles/YesIhaveanRSSfeed.html"/>http://michaelw.net/Articles/YesIhaveanRSSfeed.html</a>
<p>And the latest version of Syndirella can eat his dates but he still has it all screwed up.  I think that he is outputting GMT for when he started the post but marking the date with EST.  Then, when displaying it on his HTML site, he is outputting true EST for the last change of the post.  Times zones and weblogs are hard.  It sounds like they are even harder in CityDesk.  Dates and times are something that everyone stumbles on wrt weblog software..  I know that <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> has had some problems too.

<p>My wife, Rachel, has her blog up and running.  It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with computers or code.  Instead of being a computer dork, she is going to be a medical dork!  She is going to tell funny stories from the hospital.

Okay, Chris, what <i>do</i> you want in the FTP upstreamer?  I don't think that Radio's upstreamer deletes either.  Here is what I can do easily:
<ul>
<li>CD to a directory.  Throw if the dir isn't there.
<li>[done] Ensure a directory.  Try my best to make sure that a directory (and the path up to it) exists.
<li>Delete a directory.  The server will probably return an error if there are files in it.  I will throw.
<li>Get the current directory.
<li>Move up a direcotry.
<li>[done] Upload a file into the current directory.
<li>Download a file in the current directory and return a stream.  It would be easiest to buffer the entire file in memory.
<li>Delete a file in the current directory.
<li>[done] Return a text string with the current directory listing.
<li>Call SYST and return whatever the system gives us.  This might help detect the type of system on the other end.
</ul>
<p>The only thing that isn't easy and that will probably take quite a while to get right is parsing the output of the directory listing.  I don't have a bunch of servers to test this against to make sure it will work.
<p>As for the upstreamer itself, I'd rather have it not try and sync the stuff on the server (and hence delete stuff) because I'd be afraid of loosing data.  For instance, I upstream into the root of my site and I have all sorts of subdirs off of that.  I'm setting up a weblog for Rachel on eightypercent.net and her root will be a subdir.  I don't want to clobber her stuff whenever I upload my site.

<P>I coded up non passive FTP support for my FTP code.  It only took me ~30 mins.  I've handed that off to Chris so perhaps it will show up in BlogX at some point.  If not, I may write a standalone utility and release that.
<P>It was pretty easy to send the PORT command and start accepting connections.  I had to mess around a little bit to get it right so I wish that the documentation around using sockets was better.  For instance, there is no short sample that shows creating a socket, binding it to an address and then accepting connections.
<P>BTW, my router (Linksys wireless/4 port) works with both passive and regular FTP connections.  It must be monitoring the control connection and (a) rewriting it with the public FTP address and (b) opening the port through to my machine.  These little boxes are just amazing.
