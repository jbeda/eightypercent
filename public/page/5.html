        Tony <a href="http://ponderer.org/index.xml">posts some comments</a> about 20% time
        at Google and how it might not work at other companies like MS.&#160; Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/19.html#a9686">responds</a> based
        on how he *thinks* 20% time works.&#160; In the comments Tony backs down because he
        doesn't have specific knowledge of how things work at Microsoft.&#160; I'd like to
        add some more comments to this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Google model of development is more than just information sharing and the ability
        to switch projects.&#160; Here are the important points as I've seen.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There is, by and large, only one code base at Google.&#160; This has many advantages.&#160;
            Most obvious is that it is really easy to look at and contribute to code in other
            projects without having to talk to anyone, get special permissions or fill out forms
            in triplicate.&#160; That is just the tip of the iceberg, though.&#160; Having one
            codebase means that there is a very high degree of code sharing.&#160; Need to base
            64 encode/decode something?&#160; No problem, there is a standard Google routine for
            that.&#160; Found a bug?&#160; Just fix it and check it in after getting it code reviewed
            by a documented owner.&#160; One of the reasons that environments like Perl, Python,
            C#, Java, etc. flourish is that they have large and well through out libraries of
            useful code.&#160; For a variety of reasons, C++ has never had this.&#160; (I could
            theorize but that would be off topic.)&#160; Google has solved this problem by building
            up a large library of well documented and easy to integrate code.&#160; This not only
            lowers the bar for new projects but makes it easy to switch projects as you don't
            have to learn new conventions.</li>
        <li>
            Switching teams at Google is a very fluid process.&#160; An&#160;engineer&#160;can
            be 40% on one project, 40% on something completely different and 20% on his or her
            own thing.&#160; That mix can be adjusted as project requirements change.&#160; Switching
            groups should also not have an affect on your annual review score because of arbitrary
            team politics.&#160;&#160;&#160;Joining a new group is more about find a good mutual
            fit then going through HR and a formal interview loop.&#160; When there is an important
            project that needs to be staffed the groups and execs will evangelize that need and
            someone who is interested is bound to step up.&#160; If it is critical to the business
            and no one is stepping up (I don't know if this has occurred or not) then I imagine
            it would go come down to a personal appeal by the management team.</li>
        <li>
            The intranet in Google is super transparent.&#160; Teams are actively encouraged to
            share the most intimate details of their projects with the rest of the company.&#160;
            This happens through tech talks, design docs, lunch table conversations, etc.&#160;
            When two teams are doing similar things, people start with the assumption that they
            must have their reasons and that the situation will be worked out in time.&#160; There
            isn't a huge push to over optimize and have only one solution for each problem.&#160;
            This means that there isn't an adversarial relationship between teams that can lead
            to long standing animosities and information hiding.</li>
        <li>
            There is a big difference between&#160;pet projects being permitted and being encouraged.&#160;
            At Google it is actively encouraged for engineers to do a 20% project.&#160; This
            isn't a matter of doing something in your <em>spare time, </em>but more of actively
            making time for it.&#160; Heck, I don't have a good 20% project yet and I need one.&#160;
            If I don't come up with something I'm sure it could negatively impact my review.</li>
        <li>
            The intrapersonal environment at Google is very energizing. When someone comes up
            with a new idea, the most common response is excitement and a brainstorming session.&#160;
            Politics and who owns what&#160;area rarely enter into it.&#160; I don't think that
            I've seen anyone really raise their voice and get into a huge knockdown drag out fight
            since coming to Google.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Can 20% time work at other companies? I'm sure that there are going to be others that
        try.&#160; However, I think that it is important to realize that it is a result of
        an environment and philosophy to development more than a cause.&#160; I don't think
        that it is something that can be imposed in an independent way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd like to stress that these comments are my own and aren't any sort of official
        word from Google.&#160; Please don't draw any grand conclusions of corporate strategy
        and such.

        A <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/25.html">while ago</a> I needed
        to do some stuff in Photoshop that wasn't easy to do from the interface.&#160; I decided
        to automate it from C#.
    </p>
    <p>
        John Deurbrouck just sent me a link to a page where he has decoded some more of the
        wacky photoshop ScriptListener output.&#160; He even has a routine to drive PS to
        convert a RAW image.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check it out <a href="http://www.pcpix.com/Photoshop/">here</a>&#160;and contact John
        if you are interested in moving&#160;the knowledge in this area forward.&#160;

        Very cool, John!

        I have this urge to go retro, switch back to film and dig out my darkroom stuff.&#160;
        I think the real motivation is to buy an outrageously expensive Leica customized with
        my engraved signature on it.&#160; Try it out for yourself <a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/alacarte/index/language/en/">here</a>.&#160;
        My camera came out to $4020.&#160; I assume shipping is extra.&#160; I know that a
        lens is.&#160; "Add to my cart."

        Okay -- when people <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jbeda/231/#231881">ask
        me</a> to update in my comments it has probably been too long. I don't have anything
        super pithy to say, so I guess I'll just use the shotgun approach: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everything is going good with the baby.&#160; Rachel is starting to get big!&#160;
            We are reading to her every night and trying to get our lives in order so that we
            are ready.&#160; We are almost through "The Witch and the Wardrobe." We've been reading
            a chapter each night.&#160; After we are done we will continue reading the rest of
            the <a href="http://www.narnia.com/">Narnia</a> stories out loud&#160;to each other
            and the baby.&#160; I know she can't understand what is going on but I want her to
            know my voice. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We went to Chicago last weekend.&#160; My Sister threw Rachel a baby shower at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/chicagorc/">Ritz-Carlton</a> downtown.&#160;
            The service in the garden was wonderful.&#160; My sister's two girls had an especially
            great time. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I've been buying some cool stuff.&#160; The first is my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/28.html#a224">terabyte
            array</a> for my main computer.&#160; I ended up with five 300GB SATA drives in a
            cage running software RAID 5.&#160; That comes out to ~1.2TB after you factor out
            the redundency.&#160; I didn't get a dedicated machine to keep costs down.&#160; I
            can always do that later and move the drives over.&#160; Everything has been running
            like a champ. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Also to prepare I picked up a Canon <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=145&amp;modelid=10599">SD300</a>.&#160;
            This is an update to our aging <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/s100.html">S100</a> (the
            original digital Elph) point and shoot.&#160; It is amazing how much these things
            have improved.&#160; I loved the S100 but the SD300 is <em>so</em> much better.&#160;
            My favorite feature is that it can do 640x480x30fps movies until the card is full.&#160;
            For short clips there is no reason to get a video camera.&#160; I also ordered a 1GB
            SD card but those are apparently sold out everywhere. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm thinking about getting a new car as the baby approaches.&#160; I want to take
            a serious look at the <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/models/model_overview.asp?ModelName=Element">Honda
            Element</a>.&#160; Having an interior made of rubber that you can hose down sound
            like a good idea with kids. Plus, it is only $21k completely decked out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Between Rachel and me, we've recently read the entire <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=raymond+chandler">Raymond
            Chandler</a> catalog.&#160; I love his writing.&#160; You can just feel vintage LA
            ooze from the pages. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I haven't been taking many photos lately.&#160; I have some more stuff&#160;from the&#160;<a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/27.html">Arizona
            trip</a> that I should post.&#160; I haven't put up any of my slot canyon photos yet.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Work has been going great.&#160; I still can't talk about what I'm working on but
            I really feel like I've made it over the hump of moving to a new environment and I'm
            starting to be really productive.&#160; The contrast between Google and Microsoft
            couldn't be greater (at least from an engineer's point of view).&#160; No meetings
            and few politics means that I spend much more time coding.&#160; I've written more
            code so far at Google than I have in the last year at MS.&#160; (That really isn't
            apples to apples as I spent most of my time in the last year at MS writing specs.)&#160;
            I totally feel like I'm in the loop on my project without having to play political
            games.&#160; I guess that is what happens on smaller teams. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'd love to have some intelligent comment on the whole <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html">AutoLink</a>/<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=smarttags">SmartTags</a> thing
            as I've been around for both.&#160; However, I just don't see a clear cut answer here,
            unlike some.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, <a href="http://uploads.ungrounded.net/content.php?id=206373&amp;name=206373_numanuma.swf&amp;title=Numa%20Numa%20Dance&amp;date=1109739600&amp;quality=b&amp;uj=0&amp;w=500&amp;h=375">Numa
            Numa</a>. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That's it for now.

        Good news!&#160; We are having a baby.&#160; My wife is pregnant. I know that people
        usually say "we are pregnant" but she is the one that went through the nausea and
        has to deal with carrying the baby around for 9 months.

        is 17 weeks along -- due date is June 21st) but the ultrasound tech said that it looked
        like our baby is a girl.

        Now I have to figure out how to be a father!

        I'm watching the "Making of" for <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ia/0,1976,FOOD_16696,00.html">Iron
        Chef America</a> right now.&#160; I'm super excited.&#160; From what I've seen it
        looks like they've done a really good translation for the US market.&#160; I'm planning
        on watching the marathon tonight.&#160; I watched the William Shatner special a while
        ago and wasn't all that impressed.&#160; Hopefully this one will be better. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The real clincher for me is <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com">Alton Brown</a>.&#160;
        He does the play by play and is the guy doing most of the talking. I've been a huge
        fan of Alton for quite a while.&#160; He is the guy behind Good Eats on the food network.&#160;
        He is really the thinking person's TV chef.

        I'm trying out something new.&#160; Here is a flash app that lets you zoom in to and
        navigate around a full size version of the Horseshoe Bend pano that I posted a couple
        of days ago.&#160; Hopefully this won't kill my bandwidth.

    <p>
        Here is a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond</a>-esque tidbit that
        I wanted to get out there.&#160; I couldn't find anything on Google and had to figure
        this stuff out via trail and error. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay -- you think you know how to escape stuff on the DOS/Windows command line?&#160;
        Probably not.&#160; Let's start with a simple python script to show us what we've
        got: 
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;type dumpargs.py
# a simple program to dump the incoming arguments
import sys
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    print repr(arg)
</pre>
    <p>
        Now lets run some tests and see what it spits out: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there"
'hi there'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi \" there"
'hi " there'</pre>
    <p>
        So far so good. It looks like we know how to escape a double quote sign ("). But what
        about the pesky percent sign? DOS/Windows/Command/CMD uses this for variable substitution.
        Let's try a bunch of stuff and see what we get: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;set foo=bar

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there %foo%"
'hi there bar'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \%foo\%"
'hi there \\%foo\\%'</pre>
    <p>
        Hmmm, it looks like the backslash doesn't work. Looking around, it looks like the
        caret symbol (^) is the way to go. Lets try that out. 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py ^%foo^%
'%foo%'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there ^%foo^%"
'hi there ^%foo^%'</pre>
    <p>
        Well, it looks like that works as long as it isn't in quotes. I also found another
        wacky case: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \" ^%foo^%"
'hi there " %foo%'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \" \" ^%foo^%"
'hi there " " ^%foo^%'</pre>
    <p>
        Very odd -- it looks like the caret does work as an escape character as long as there
        is an odd number of escaped double quote characters before it in the string. The parser
        here is obviously not a simple as one might first think. Lets try ending the string
        before we quote the percent sign: 
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi there %foo% bar'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi \" there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi " there ^%foo^% bar'</pre>
    <p>
        We are getting closer, but that escaped quote character puts the parser into a wacky
        state. I finally did find a good solution: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi "^"" there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi " there %foo% bar'</pre>
    <p>
        It turns out that you must replace the double quote (") with the following sequence:
        "^"". You must also quote the percent character (%) with this sequence: "^%". I think
        that everything else is okay inside of the double quotes. Very strange but true. I
        guess this is what 20 years of back compat get you.
