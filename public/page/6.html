        This was a pretty lean day on the workshop.&#160; This was our day to go and hike
        out to "the wave."&#160; The Wave is a really cool set of sandstone rock formations
        buried in the north part of <a href="http://www.az.blm.gov/paria/cbusereg2.html">Coyote
        Buttes</a>.&#160; A permit is required to hike Coyote Buttes and the BLM restricts
        it to 10 people per day.&#160; The problem is that on the weather had taken a turn
        for the worse during the night.&#160; When we work up at 5 AM on Sunday, it was raining
        in page.&#160; As we drove toward the trailhead we gained elevation and it started
        snowing.&#160; Around 6 AM we needed to start driving on gravel roads.&#160; It was
        still snowing pretty hard and we decided to turn back.&#160; I was looking forward
        to a good hike and was disappointed that we didn't make it to the Wave. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When we got back to the motel, we picked up everyone else and went "hunting."&#160;
        Off the side of the road outside of Page, as we were climbing, we stopped to photograph
        some fresh snow on desert trees.&#160; This is one of the images that resulted. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical details: Original composition was 24 images (8x3).&#160; I cropped out just
        a corner of that to make the composition as seen above.&#160; Total images used then
        is probably more like 15 (5x3).&#160; Each was shot at 1/25 sec, f/11, ISO 100 with
        the 24-70 f/2.8L @ 50mm.&#160; Final image is 6000x6000 or 36 megapixel.

    <p>
        I know it seems hard to believe in this day and age of 300GB hard drives, but I've
        run out of hard drive space.&#160; My plan up until now was to keep a bunch of stuff
        on a <s>RAID 0</s> RAID 1 (RAID0 is simple striping with no redundency. RAID 1 is
        mirrored.) 120GB set of drives.&#160; As that fills up, I've been archiving stuff
        to DVD.&#160; The problem is that I've had to start archiving stuff sooner than I
        thought and I don't trust the DVDs.&#160; In fact, I've gotten read errors on some
        already.&#160; They may be fine for video, but I don't want to archive data on them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm faced with a couple of options.&#160; The first option is to half ass it some
        more and put a couple of more drives into my current computer.&#160; I'm hoping the
        power supply can take it.&#160; I think I can fit them in there but it may be tight.&#160;
        Thank god for serial ATA at least.&#160; I don't think I could fit them in with regular
        old parallel ATA.&#160; A Maxtor 300GB SATA drive is urrently $206 at newegg.&#160;
        300GB more (mirrored) would be a good start, but I'm sure I'd run out of space sooner
        or later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The other options I was thinking about was putting together a storage server and running
        RAID 5 (stripe set with parity -- it spreads the data across multiple drives but duplicates
        some of the data for redundency).&#160; I'd like something that I can grow with so
        I'd like to be able to increase the amount of space for just the cost of more drives.&#160;
        Here is what I came up with: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Computer guts: 
            <ul>
                <li>

                    PCI support. This is the cheapest motherboard with 64bit PCI support I could find.&#160;
                    It also comes with SATA RAID on board if I need it.&#160; Dual gigabit ethernet --
                    yum.

                    good price for a fast processor.&#160; Since I'm going to be doing RAID 5 in software
                    it seems worthwhile to pay for a decent proc.

                    It comes with a fan and a "backplane" for all of the drives.&#160; And you get cool

                    That should be enough to get me started.&#160; It uses the host processor for doing
                    the RAID 5 stuff, but it is a lot cheaper than the cards that do RAID 5 in hardware.&#160;
                    Since I'm not all that concerned with speed, the savings should be good enough.&#160;
                    The <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=16-125-005&amp;depa=0">Broadcom
                    card</a> is another option but it is $100 more.&#160; Tom's hardware did an <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20041006/index.html">interesting
                    expriment</a> with these where they drove 32 drives off of one computer.

                    This seems to be a sweet spot in capacity right now. The 250GB drives aren't that
                    much cheaper and the 400GB drives are super expensive.&#160; The Maxtor also comes
                    with a 3 year warranty. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Total price: <strong>$1913</strong> plus shipping and software.&#160; I'd probably
        run Windows as I think I have a legit copy of SBS 2k3 that MS gave me when I still
        worked there.&#160; It should run Linux fine too if all you want to do is serve files. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With RAID 5 this will give me ~900GB of redundant storage.&#160; I can easily double
        the size with another hard drive cage and a set of drives ($942).&#160; This seams
        like a pretty wild deal to me.&#160; Sure it won't be the fastest thing out there
        but it is pretty darn cheap for a ton of storage.&#160; I probably won't drop the
        money on something like this for a while, so I'm expecting it to just get cheaper. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, am I missing anything?&#160; Is someone going to come out with a turnkey system
        for half the price?&#160; The closest comparable thing I could find where the NAS
        systems that various people are selling.&#160; Nothing could touch this setup on price.&#160;
        I looked at the Apple XServe (I do love blinking lights...) but they start at $6000
        for 1TB and require fiber channel.&#160; Way overkill for me.&#160; There is also
        something like the <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10462">LaCie
        terrabyte drive</a>&#160;($1000).&#160; This seems like an amazingly bad idea to me.&#160;
        They must 4 drives in there.&#160; If one fails you loose all of your data.&#160;
        The chances of loosing all of your data is 4 times as likely. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I like pricing out stuff like this even though I may never buy it :)

              <p>

    <p>
        Last weekend I spent some time down near Page, AZ photographing some beautiful southwest
        scenery.&#160; Since I don't have the time or experience to plan something like this
        myself, I went with a group of people led by <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/about.htm">Steve
        Kossack</a>&#160;from <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/">f-8 and be there</a>.&#160;
        Steve takes people out on photography workshops to places that he knows very well.&#160;
        It is&#160;amazing what a difference an experienced leader can make to an expedition.&#160;
        I had a great time and got some amazing images from the trip. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My flight to Phoenix on Thursday got in around 1:30 pm.&#160; Steve and some of the
        other participants picked me up at the airport baggage claim.&#160; We were then immediately
        off on a pretty long drive up to Page.&#160; Page is right on the border between Arizona
        and Utah.&#160; It's on <a href="http://www.powellguide.com/lakepowell/lakepowellmap.html">Lake
        Powell</a>, a huge serpentine lake made by the Glen Canyon Dam.&#160; The Glen Canyon
        dam is on the Colorado upstream from the Grand Canyon. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once at page, we checked in to a hotel and started our 3 days of intense field photography.&#160;
        A typical day would be getting up early enough so that we could be at a good spot
        for sunrise.&#160; Up in the high desert this was pretty cold this time of year.&#160;
        Lows at night were somewhere around 35-40 degrees F.&#160; We would then photograph
        the sunrise.&#160; After that we would spend the day in locations that work well with
        overhead light.&#160; For this trip we photographed both upper and lower Antelope
        Canyons.&#160; These are amazing slot canyons that really have to be seen to be believed.&#160;
        As the day wears on we would travel to another amazing location for a sunset shoot. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides the wonderful landscapes, the other people on a trip like this make it a very
        enriching experience.&#160; It is refreshing to me to be out with people who enjoy
        photography so much.&#160; It takes a certain type of person to get up at 4:30am in
        the cold so that you can travel two hours to be in time for the morning light.&#160;
        One part of the workshop that I particularly enjoy is the print discussion.&#160;
        Steve encourages everyone to bring some prints of their work.&#160; Then, after living
        with each other for a couple of days, we get together to admire and discuss each others'
        work.&#160; Steve also brings some of his best work for us to look at. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in an experience like this and have&#160;a passion for photography,
        give Steve a call.&#160; His upcoming <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/workshops/rafting05.htm">Grand
        Canyon rafting trip</a> looks like a trip of a lifetime.&#160; I won't be able to
        make this one, but it looks like he has a couple of spots left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the images that I got -- here is a start: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Horseshoe Bend at dawn" hspace="0" src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/HSB-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /> 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is famous Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado river.&#160; The river&#160;carves a
        perfect circle as seen from&#160;the cliff overlooking the canyon.&#160; This was
        our first sunrise of the trip.&#160; I'm always a little rusty when starting out on
        something like this, but I'm happy with this result.&#160; The mountains in back (catching
        the sun first) are called the Vermillion Cliffs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical details: 20 images stitched together (3x7) shot from my Canon 20D with the
        24-70mm f/2.8L at 34mm.&#160; Exposure was 1/25th second at f/11 and ISO 200.&#160;
        I haven't done the full stitch yet (this is a small version) and so I don't know the
        final resolution. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Look for more images in the coming weeks as&#160;I sort through the boatload of data
        I captured.&#160; As a point of reference, I ended up with ~14GB of raw data from
        this trip.&#160; I'm going to run out of disk space! 
    </p>

    <p>
        I came back from my photo trip and started catching up on email and blogs.&#160; It
        looks like the Google Kirkland open house went well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The bigger news, in my mind, is the technical preview that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/avnov04ctp/default.aspx">Avalon
        guys shipped</a>.&#160; I'm going to have to download it and play around to see what
        all changed since I left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was really hoping that they would get something out before the Longhorn beta.&#160;
        I'm sure this was a ton of hard work, but I think that it proves that decoupling Avalon
        and Longhorn was really the right decision.&#160; It will allow the Avalon guys to
        go full steam ahead. 
    </p>
    <p>
        BTW, <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's blog</a> is a good place to start
        on some of this stuff.&#160; He has an app that you can download and play with.

    With the advent of our new office, a lot of people have been asking (via email or
    comments on the blog here) about jobs at the Kirkland office.&#160; For a variety
    of reasons, I really can't do much on the recruiting side.&#160; If I've worked with
    you and you don't work for Microsoft, feel free to drop me a line.&#160; Otherwise,
    your best bet is to send email to <a href="mailto:jobs@google.com">jobs@google.com</a> as
    specified <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/">here</a>.&#160; Even though Kirkland
    isn't listed there, I'm sure you can reference the office in any email you send. I
    wish I could be everybody's inside line, but I can't.

    <p>
        I've been super busy at work for the last few weeks.&#160; We've been iterating on
        our stuff and have come up with some cool plans.&#160; Hopefully we can turn those
        into reality and ship them.&#160; I wish I could say more but I really can't.&#160;
        I think that one of the reasons that Google is so reluctant to speak publicly about
        what they are doing is partly to surprise the competition and partly so that we have
        the freedom to try stuff without committing to deliver it.&#160; There may be some
        stuff that never sees the light of day, but it is better than announcing it and then
        it never seeing the light of day.&#160; I think that this probably makes it easier
        to pull the plug on projects that just aren't converging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides work, some other things are going on that I think are pretty exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I've been helping to port <a href="http://enblend.sourceforge.net">enblend</a> to
        build and run natively under Windows.&#160; Enblend is a cool tool to help in the
        blending stage of making digital panoramas.&#160; My (limited) understanding of the
        mechanics is that it converts the images into the frequency domain to come up with
        an optimal blending mask.&#160; Sometime soon I'd like to start delving into the hard
        parts (Math) and get a better understanding of what is going on.&#160; Andrew (the
        guy who wrote enblend) just released version 2.1 out into the wild.&#160; Let us know
        if you have any problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, I'm going to be missing the Google open house (a rockin' party scheduled for
        Thursday night) so that I can take a trip down to Page, Arizona to shoot slot canyons
        and other various rock formations.&#160; I'm going to be doing a lot of panorama and
        digital mosaic work so look for some cool images soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        One interesting photography note: I've had one of my large pano's printed up pretty
        large -- about 40" x 25" (100cm x 64cm, for those of you of the metric persuasion)
        and have it framed and hanging outside my office.&#160; Even at that large size, the
        photo is tack sharp.&#160; It is really a lot of fun to make images that large.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, and Halo 2.

        <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2004/10/googles-kirkland-office.html">It's true</a> --
        Google is opening a development office in Kirkland.&#160; In fact, we are moving tonight
        into our new offices.&#160; So far there has been a small group of us working in some
        temporary offices.&#160; It is going to be nice to move into a more permanent space
        where we can actually talk about work in the hallways! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other nice things about moving: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Someone else is going to get and stock the drink fridge.&#160; We've been doing it
            so far by assigning people to make Costco runs. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We'll have an espresso machine so we can all practice our barista skills. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Conference rooms we can use any time we want. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We can hang our own art on the walls. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Faster connection to the internet and to Mountain View. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <s>Google colored bean bags everywhere.</s> Apparently the company that makes the
            google beanbags isn't making them any more. I didn't ask as I assume this is a long
            and complicated story.&#160; Don't worry -- we'll have foosball instead. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Lots and lots of whiteboards. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Stay tuned for more details!&#160; We are planning an open house&#160;party so that
        Seattle knows we are here.&#160; I don't think we can <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/26.html#a8523">invite
        thousands of people</a> like Scoble is suggesting -- they just wouldn't fit.&#160;
        Unfortunately I won't be around for the party because I'm going to be out of town
        on a photography trip.&#160; I'm really&#160;disappointed&#160;I'm going to miss it.

              <p>

    <p>
        I spent the last weekend in Chicago visiting my parents and my sister's family and
        her three adorable kids.&#160; (Hi Harper, Ellie and Tate!)
    </p>
    <p>
        We combined this trip with my wife&#160;Rachel's first marathon!&#160; We took the
        train downtown early on Sunday morning and got there in plenty of time for the start.&#160;
        It was a complete mob scene.&#160; There were 40,000 people signed up to run the marathon.&#160;
        It took Rachel 15 minutes or so to actually get to the start line.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I cut across the course and was able to see her run by at the halfway mark.&#160;
        I then took my time walking to the finish line so that I could try to catch a glimpse
        of her on the home stretch.&#160; I missed her there but was able to meet up with
        her in the park outside the finish.&#160; Right after she finished she collapsed on
        me and said that it was the hardest thing she ever did and also the best.&#160; That
        is something coming from someone who finished a medical internship.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm so proud of her running it!&#160; Now all she has to do is let her feet heal.&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        Interesting stuff:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everyone is timed with what is called a "champion chip."&#160; This is a little device
            that you tie on to your shoe that marks when you step on checkpoints along the course.&#160;
            They had 10 of these checkpoints total.&#160; I'm not sure what technology they use,
            but it seems to work pretty well.&#160; There would be no way to get an accurate time
            for 40k people without something like this.</li>
        <li>
            Right after Rachel finished someone in front of her called for a medic.&#160; A woman
            and her father had apparently just finished together when he collapsed on the ground.&#160;
            He was still talking but obviously dizzy and confused.&#160; Rachel introduced herself
            as a doctor and volunteered to help.&#160;&#160;She checked his pulse on his wrist
            and in his neck.&#160; If you have a pulse in your wrist, your blood pressure is at
            least 90.&#160; If it is in your neck it is at least 60.&#160; Since the man had a
            pulse in his neck but not in his wrist he had a blood pressure under 90.&#160; She
            sat with them until the medics arrived and he was wheeled away.&#160; We both hope
            everything is okay!</li>
        <li>
            There is a company that tries to take pictures of everyone.&#160; Apparently they
            just shoot away and try to sort it all out later.&#160; Last night when we checked
            the site they had finished going through 22% of the photos they had taken and had
            three pictures of Rachel online.&#160; I can't imagine dealing with that many pictures!&#160;
            I'm wondering if they have some sort&#160;of OCR system to read the bib numbers off
            the runners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I took some pictures but I haven't had a chance to sort through them yet.&#160; Hopefully
        I can put one or two up in the next couple of days.

              <p>

    <p>
        Adobe announced today a new image format for storing raw camera data.&#160; Dubbed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/main.html">DNG</a>&#160;(for
        Digital Negative) this format is meant to be a common interchange for the fast proliferating
        collection of proprietary raw image formats.&#160; By some estimates there are over
        60 different raw image formats out there.&#160; Because of this, there are really
        only a couple of software vendors that can afford to get into the raw image processing
        game.&#160; It appears that Adobe hopes to level this playing field with this new
        specification. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand the significance of this, it is important that you understand how raw
        image formats work and why they are different.&#160; When most modern cameras (not
        using the <a href="http://www.foveon.com/X3_tech.html">Foveon</a> sensor) advertise
        take a picture, they have a grid of sensors.&#160; These sensors only measure intensity
        but not color.&#160; To capture color data, a color filter (called a Bayer filter)
        is placed over the sensor so that each little sensor only sees one color (typically
        Red, Green and Blue).&#160; That means that the camera only knows one color value
        at each pixel.&#160; This raw data is then processed using a set of complex algorithms
        to produce an image that has all the color information for each pixel.&#160; For each
        pixel in the raw data, these algorithms reconstruct the missing color data by looking
        at the surrounding pixels and <em>guessing</em>.&#160; Because of this guessing, there
        are multiple ways to process this raw data -- and there is the possibility that these
        algorithms and guessing will get better in the future.&#160; Because of this, all
        serious cameras offer a raw mode where the raw (or close to it) sensor data is saved
        in a special format and the complex demosaicing algorithms can be done later on a
        computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, raw images are fundamentally different from regular images in that they store
        raw sensor data before it has been processed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The rub comes with the fact that each camera manufacturer has a proprietary raw format
        (or two or three) and some generally crappy software for dealing with it.&#160; Companies
        like Adobe (with the Adobe Camera Raw plugin for photoshop) and Capture One have been
        waging a guerilla war to create products to read all of these formats.&#160; If Adobe
        can succeed in getting camera manufacturers to implement this format in their cameras,
        life for many photographers could become much much easier.&#160; But this isn't a
        sure thing.&#160; Camera manufacturers are very aware of the business benefits of
        lock in.&#160; They do it with lens mounts and with their software suites.&#160; Canon
        or Nikon may see their proprietary formats as an advantage in the marketplace.&#160;
        Nikon even charges for the software to convert its raw format while Canon and most
        other manufacturers provide it for free. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't gotten a read from my buddies in Microsoft imaging, but I'm hoping that
        DNG is a huge success.&#160; Assuming that Adobe doesn't try to assert its own proprietary
        control over the format (Postscript anyone?) it may just let the camera manufacturers
        concentrate on making cameras and leave the software development up to a third party
        marketplace. 
    </p>
    <p>
        [update: RichB points out that there is also an open source utility for dealing with
        raw camera data called <a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">DCRaw</a> and
        built by Dave Coffin. Apparently Photoshop (and Capture One?) build on some of Dave's
        work.]

        <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> and I hung out tonight and went
        to dinner together.&#160; We started out from my house in Montlake and walked through
        the university to Aladdin Gyro's up north of 45th on the Ave.&#160; We were going
        to go to Thai Tom but the line was too long. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We talked about Google, Microsoft and the industry as a whole.&#160; Tip jars, Bush
        and how I should never expect to get social security (I already knew this).&#160;
        He's a good guy who likes to shake things up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since everyone wanted to see me wearing my Noogler hat, I had him snap a quick picture
        with my new Canon 20D.&#160; I also grabbed a picture of him. We are both looking
        a little worse for wear from the long walk up there and back. 
    </p>

        If you really want to chew up some of my bandwidth (I may have to take this down)
        you can grab the original files (~2MB each) of <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/NooglerHat-orig.jpg">me</a> and <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/DaveWiner-orig.jpg">Dave</a>.&#160;
        These are jpgs right out the camera.&#160; Be warned that they are shot in the AdobeRGB
        color space so you should really view them in a color space aware application (something
        more like Photoshop and not IE).

        [Update:&#160; <a href="http://www.freeke.org/ffg">Dave Walker</a> suggested I check
