    <p>
        Adobe announced today a new image format for storing raw camera data.&#160; Dubbed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/main.html">DNG</a>&#160;(for
        Digital Negative) this format is meant to be a common interchange for the fast proliferating
        collection of proprietary raw image formats.&#160; By some estimates there are over
        60 different raw image formats out there.&#160; Because of this, there are really
        only a couple of software vendors that can afford to get into the raw image processing
        game.&#160; It appears that Adobe hopes to level this playing field with this new
        specification. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand the significance of this, it is important that you understand how raw
        image formats work and why they are different.&#160; When most modern cameras (not
        using the <a href="http://www.foveon.com/X3_tech.html">Foveon</a> sensor) advertise
        take a picture, they have a grid of sensors.&#160; These sensors only measure intensity
        but not color.&#160; To capture color data, a color filter (called a Bayer filter)
        is placed over the sensor so that each little sensor only sees one color (typically
        Red, Green and Blue).&#160; That means that the camera only knows one color value
        at each pixel.&#160; This raw data is then processed using a set of complex algorithms
        to produce an image that has all the color information for each pixel.&#160; For each
        pixel in the raw data, these algorithms reconstruct the missing color data by looking
        at the surrounding pixels and <em>guessing</em>.&#160; Because of this guessing, there
        are multiple ways to process this raw data -- and there is the possibility that these
        algorithms and guessing will get better in the future.&#160; Because of this, all
        serious cameras offer a raw mode where the raw (or close to it) sensor data is saved
        in a special format and the complex demosaicing algorithms can be done later on a
        computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, raw images are fundamentally different from regular images in that they store
        raw sensor data before it has been processed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The rub comes with the fact that each camera manufacturer has a proprietary raw format
        (or two or three) and some generally crappy software for dealing with it.&#160; Companies
        like Adobe (with the Adobe Camera Raw plugin for photoshop) and Capture One have been
        waging a guerilla war to create products to read all of these formats.&#160; If Adobe
        can succeed in getting camera manufacturers to implement this format in their cameras,
        life for many photographers could become much much easier.&#160; But this isn't a
        sure thing.&#160; Camera manufacturers are very aware of the business benefits of
        lock in.&#160; They do it with lens mounts and with their software suites.&#160; Canon
        or Nikon may see their proprietary formats as an advantage in the marketplace.&#160;
        Nikon even charges for the software to convert its raw format while Canon and most
        other manufacturers provide it for free. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't gotten a read from my buddies in Microsoft imaging, but I'm hoping that
        DNG is a huge success.&#160; Assuming that Adobe doesn't try to assert its own proprietary
        control over the format (Postscript anyone?) it may just let the camera manufacturers
        concentrate on making cameras and leave the software development up to a third party
        marketplace. 
    </p>
    <p>
        [update: RichB points out that there is also an open source utility for dealing with
        raw camera data called <a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">DCRaw</a> and
        built by Dave Coffin. Apparently Photoshop (and Capture One?) build on some of Dave's
        work.]

        <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> and I hung out tonight and went
        to dinner together.&#160; We started out from my house in Montlake and walked through
        the university to Aladdin Gyro's up north of 45th on the Ave.&#160; We were going
        to go to Thai Tom but the line was too long. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We talked about Google, Microsoft and the industry as a whole.&#160; Tip jars, Bush
        and how I should never expect to get social security (I already knew this).&#160;
        He's a good guy who likes to shake things up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since everyone wanted to see me wearing my Noogler hat, I had him snap a quick picture
        with my new Canon 20D.&#160; I also grabbed a picture of him. We are both looking
        a little worse for wear from the long walk up there and back. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/NooglerHat-sm.jpg"><img alt="Joe Beda wearing his Noogler hat" hspace="0" src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/NooglerHat-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/DaveWiner-sm.jpg"><img alt="Dave Winer" hspace="0" src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/DaveWiner-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /></a>

        If you really want to chew up some of my bandwidth (I may have to take this down)
        you can grab the original files (~2MB each) of <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/NooglerHat-orig.jpg">me</a> and <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/DaveWiner-orig.jpg">Dave</a>.&#160;
        These are jpgs right out the camera.&#160; Be warned that they are shot in the AdobeRGB
        color space so you should really view them in a color space aware application (something
        more like Photoshop and not IE).

        cache by NYU as a way to reduce the bandwidth hit.&#160; The links above have been

        Taking a break from inadvertently feeding the rumor mill, I'd like to point to the
        announcement for the new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0409/04092104canoneos1dsmkii.asp">Canon
        1Ds Mark II</a>.&#160; This thing looks awesome!&#160; Features that stand out: 16.7
        MP full frame, fast startup time and a wireless transfer option.&#160; There is still
        a question if they improved the battery technology or not.&#160; Not bad for a&#160;mere
        $8k.&#160; The thing still looks super big and heavy.

        I would love to own one of these, but I can't see my self spending that much on what
        is really a hobby.&#160; Plus, in the spirit of sour grapes, it would probably be
        too heavy.&#160; I really can't complain because I just received&#160;the Canon 20D
        that I preordered a little while ago.&#160; Now I have to find the time to go out
        and shoot.

        This media stuff is pretty crazy.&#160; I don't think that someone like me moving

    <p>
        One correction:&#160; I wasn't <em>the</em> lead developer on Avalon, but rather one
        of many lead developers.&#160; The group is pretty big and my leaving, while I'm sure
        they will miss having me around, won't put the project in jeopardy or anything.

        They call new Google employees Nooglers.&#160; That was what I was last week when
        I was down in Mountain View.&#160; It was a pretty exciting week.&#160; I went to
        some training classes and got my computers set up and such.&#160; I spent quite a
        bit of time working and hanging out with other Googlers.&#160; Everyone was super
        smart and down to earth.&#160; I learned a lot and had a great time.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the week I got my Noogler hat (propeller on top, of course) at a company
        wide friday event.&#160; I've been digging in this week back in Seattle.&#160; I'm
        hoping that I can get my first checkin in by thursday.&#160; My only job now is to
        write code and ship product.&#160; That is about all I can say too :)

        I met with HR yesterday afternoon to turn in my batch and my corporate AmEx card.&#160;
        It felt like a cheesy cop show:&#160; "Gimme your badge and your gun, Mahoney -- you're
        suspended!"&#160; Right after that I went back to my building and had a buddy sign
        me in as a visitor so that we could all hang out and play some xbox.&#160; It&#160;was
        hard to let go and not get involved in the discussions going on in the hallways.&#160;
        The day before a large group of us went out for my goodbye lunch.&#160; It felt a
        little bit like a funeral in its finality.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        First off, I'd like to say that everyone has been really good about my leaving --
        both inside and outside of the company.&#160; I think that most everyone understands
        that 7 years is a long time and that I've "done my time."&#160; Thanks for all of
        the Congrats!

        had some nice stuff to say.&#160; I got contacted by a reporter from CNet looking

        My plan this weekend was to get a very tall (30 foot) ladder and clean my gutters.&#160;

    <p>
        Tomorrow, friday, is my last day at Microsoft.&#160; I've been there for a little
        over 7 years, plus 2 internships.&#160; I've helped (in large or small part) ship
        Microsoft Team Manager, IE4, IE5, IE5.5, IE6, Windows NT 4, Windows 98, Windows 98SE,
        Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2k3 and Windows XP SP2.&#160; I've been
        working with a great group of people on Avalon and Longhorn for the past couple of
        years.&#160; It is really hard to say goodbye to so many friends and such a great
        group.&#160; But I feel that it is time to move on to new challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to be going to go work for Google.&#160; It looks like I'll be staying in
        the Seattle area for now.&#160; Don't ask me what I'll be doing because I honestly
        don't know.&#160; I'm going to be working with a good group of guys that I've worked
        with before.&#160; I trust that they are working on interesting technology.&#160;
        Hopefully we'll be able to make a splash at some point.&#160; Chances are that I won't
        be able to talk about it here for quite a while though.
    </p>
    <p>
        The decision to leave Microsoft has been a very difficult one.&#160; I still believe
        in the Avalon vision and plan.&#160; I'm more excited than ever about the technology.&#160;
        Even though I knew that I was going to leave a couple of weeks ago, I meant everything
        that I've posted and said.&#160; You can be sure that my excitement over the recent
        changes to the Longhorn and Avalon ship plans <em>aren't</em> the company line.&#160;
        If I disagreed I would have said so.&#160; What are they going to do, fire me?&#160;
        In some ways I feel like I've made my impact on the Avalon project.&#160; I've been
        there since the start and helped shape what it is today.&#160; There is a lot of work
        to do yet, but the broad strokes are in place.&#160; Now I'm just like most of you
        reading this: I'm going to be a user of the Avalon technology instead of one of the
        guys developing it.&#160; I wish those losers would get off their butts and ship already
        :)

        It has been an exciting month and a half or so.&#160; I sat down for coffee with a
        coworker who is working for Google sometime in late July.&#160; We chatted and he
        told me about the way that Google works and how much fun he was having there.&#160;
        The thing that really attracted me was the fact that it was just a smaller company
        with smaller groups.&#160; After working on such large projects for so long, I was
        really ready to try something on a smaller scale.&#160; Plus, I've been working for
        MS for my entire professional life and I'm going to have to diversify at some point.&#160;
        Anyway, I got a resume to him and flew down to Mountain View for an interview.&#160;
        Things went well and I accepted&#160;the offer last week.&#160; As a point of reference,
        I didn't find out about the Longhorn schedule shake up until a few weeks after I started
        the whole process.
    </p>
    <p>
        What does this mean for my blog?&#160; Nothing really.&#160; I'm still going to talk
        Avalon -- I just won't have the inside line anymore.&#160; My knowledge will probably
        go stale in the next month or so.&#160; Eventually I hope to talk about Google stuff,
        but I'm going to have to feel out where the lines are.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Wish me luck!

        Rachel and I went to a reading from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312324839/qid=1094054140/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-5121671-1377764?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">"On
        Call: A Doctor's Days and Nights in Residency" by Emily Transue</a> last night.&#160;
        Emily is a friend of ours and was my wife Rachel's chief resident when she started
        residency.&#160; I haven't had a chance to read the book yet (we picked up a copy
        last night) but, from the excerpts that Emily read aloud, it sounds great.&#160; If
        you don't know someone who's been through residency (or even if you do!) this book
        will give you an understanding of the ups and downs -- both emotionally and physically
        -- that a doctor goes through during residency.&#160; I saw it up close and personal
        while Rachel was going through it.

        Everyone is still digesting what exactly is going on with Avalon, WinFS and Longhorn.&#160; <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/30.html#a8167">Scoble</a> is
        a great place to start for links to the reaction in general.&#160; ChrisAn also has
        some <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/8ccbbce9-0ec7-408f-9209-6ef233850dbb">Q&amp;A
        on what this means to Avalon</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that I can answer some more questions that people might have.&#160; I'll take
        the Q&amp;A format that ChrisAn used. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. What does this mean for the Avalon graphics architecture as you </strong><a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/18.html"><strong>presented
        it at WinHEC</strong></a><strong>?<br />
        </strong>Actually, things&#160;mostly don't change from an architectural point of
        view.&#160; We will have to make some tweaks and compromises to ensure that Avalon
        runs well on XP and W2K3.&#160; All of these compromises will be because we probably
        won't be able to update&#160;any&#160;system binaries (User32, GDI, etc.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. You said that Avalon <em>had</em> to have Longhorn to work well.&#160;
        Now it is going to run on XP and W2k3.&#160; What gives?</strong> 
        <br />
        There were some very good reasons for us to restrict Avalon to run just on Longhorn.&#160;
        However, when looking at what customers said and our schedule, it made more sense
        to bend on some of those reasons than to force developers to wait for wide adoption
        of Longhorn before being able to write apps.&#160; Here are some areas where we are
        going to have to get creative in making Avalon work on XP and W2k3: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Lack of the LDDM (Longhorn Device Driver Model). </em>Right now the XPDM (XP Driver
            Model), wrt DX, is really built to work well for one app at a time.&#160; It&#160;uses
            first come, first server, winner take all approach to resource allocation.&#160; While
            Avalon runs just fine on the XPDM, it isn't clear that&#160;lots of Avalon apps running
            at the same time will work really well without the LDDM.&#160; There are also concerns
            around the stability of current DX drivers under the XPDM.&#160; These drivers have
            been written with the gaming market in mind.&#160; Using them for every day applications
            may push them to some breaking points.&#160; All sorts of options are being considered
            on how to deal with this.&#160; And for machines that we can't support hardware acceleration
            on, we always have our software rendering layer that we can fall back to.&#160; Early
            on we decided no to rely on hardware being available on every machine.&#160; That
            decision is paying off now. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Inability to really tweak User32. </em>In Longhorn builds we had the ability to
            do "child window redirection".&#160; This is a Win32 interop solution where child
            hWnds get redirected by the system to a bitmap that the Avalon compositor then hosts.&#160;
            This allowed Win32 content to alpha blend and rotate just like any Avalon content.&#160;
            Since we won't be able to change system binaries on older systems, we won't be able
            to do this redirection on XP and W2k3.&#160; We'll have to find a compromise solution
            to hosting legacy content.&#160; You probably won't be able to treat it like regular
            Avalon content.&#160; Eventually we want to be able to support these advanced legacy
            hosting solutions, but it probably won't work on XP and W2k3. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Terminal Services and Remote Desktop. </em>We were planning on remoting Avalon
            at a completely different layer.&#160; It is unclear how we will address this issue
            on platforms other than Longhorn.&#160; The long term plan and architecture still
            encompasses enhanced remoting. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Media decoding system.&#160; </em>A lot of the video hosting relied on components
            being delivered from the media team.&#160; Since we are now perhaps shipping via a
            different mechanism than they are, the level of integration and interdependencies
            are now up in the air.&#160; We are working on figure that out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Desktop Window Manager.&#160; </em>The DWM will still exist and be included as
            part of Longhorn.&#160; There are no plans to make the DWM run on XP and W2k3.&#160;
            The cross process UCE architecture presented at WinHEC remains unchanged for when
            Avalon apps are running under the DWM on Longhorn. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>3. How has the Avalon vision changed?&#160; Is it a less ambitious plan now?<br />
        </strong>The long term Avalon vision hasn't changed.&#160; We still want to enable
        the same hardware accelerated, media rich, easy to develop, network connected&#160;application
        platform that we've been talking about since the 2003 PDC.&#160; The real change here
        is a new pragmatic staged approach to getting it out the door and in the hands of
        developers.&#160; If we've talked about some feature or doodad that has to be compromised
        to make Avalon work under these new constraints, don't worry.&#160; Chances are that
        that feature is still on the list for when we <em>can </em>do it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4. What is your personal opinion on these changes, Joe?<br />
        </strong>Thanks for asking!&#160; Personally I'm really excited by these changes.&#160;
        It is painful to have to sacrifice (at least when running on XP and W2k3 -- they may
        "light up on Longhorn") some of the features that <em>require</em> deep changes to
        the system but the overall result of being able to deliver Avalon to XP and W2k3 outweigh
        that pain dramatically.&#160; Anything we can do to get Avalon out the door on a more
        deterministic schedule and to deliver it to a wider audience of developers seems like
        a good thing to me.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Making hard decisions like this is necessary to get big projects out the door.&#160;
        While it would have been great if we had figured some of this stuff out a year (or
        more) ago, this is better late than never.&#160; $50 billion in the bank (or whatever
        it is these days) is a lot of money but it still doesn't buy you a crystal ball to
        see in to the future.
