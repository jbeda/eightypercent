    <p>
        There has been a ton of speculation on SVG and its relationship (or lack thereof)
        to Avalon.&#160; Here is some thoughts on that, collected from various responses I've
        made or others have made. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Our rendering model is very much like that of SVG.&#160; We support a hierarchical
            compositing model with transforms that affect items in the hiearchy. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Our markup isn't the same mostly because XAML is a direct reflection of the programming
            model.&#160; There is a very solid relationship between the markup and the objects
            and methods. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Our OM doesn't match the SVG DOM because we choose to go with an object model that
            more closely matches what we think <em>our</em> users expect.&#160; Specifically,
            we tried hard to make sure that our object model provided a certain amount of consistency
            with WinForms (and VB and MFC before it)&#160;and ASP.Net.&#160; Beyond this, our
            object model is strongly typed where much of the SVG DOM is based around strings.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            WVG is a term that we are no longer using and isn't, in my opinion, very useful.&#160;
            We were supposed to have scrubbed this from our documentation, but apparently we missed
            some stuff.&#160; There is no strick subset of Avalon objects and XAML markup that
            stands on its own with respect to vector graphics.&#160; 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Whereas when using SVG inside of XHTML there is a very&#160;bright line, when using
                    a vector graphic element in a UI authored in XAML, there is no sharp line.&#160; You
                    can put a Rectangle element, for example, in flow with a document without a Canvas
                    element.&#160; To do a similar thing with XHTML/SVG, you would need to wrap all SVG
                    content in an SVG element.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Avalon, the set of properties and property types is the same between vector graphics
                    elements and other elements.&#160; In this way the background property for a Button
                    is of type Brush -- the same as the fill property for a Rectangle. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are elements that can very easily be seen to belong to both a control subset
                    and a vector graphics subset.&#160; For example, Image makes sense in a UI sense but
                    also in a VG sense.&#160; XHTML and SVG both have image elements.&#160; We avoid this
                    duplicity.&#160; Text is another area where we avoid a large amount of duplication. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            While we share a rendering model with SVG to a large extent, our support and features
            don't match up completely.&#160; Some of it is stuff that we haven't implemented yet
            and others are due to choices that we've made because of programming model concerns.&#160;
            I'll try to put together a guide on this stuff at some point in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I'm sure there are questions around SVG and XAML/Avalon that I haven't answered here.&#160;
        Post in the comments and I'll update this post with the latest and greatest.
