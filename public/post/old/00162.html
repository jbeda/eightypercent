        How can I get to the underlying DX9-esque interface I know you guys gotta be using
        this stuff. I don't want to deal with EllipseGeometry objects and the like, gimme
        DrawPrimitive, push buffers, and pain-in-the ass ITexture objects.

        Don't worry dude!&#160; The details are still being worked out, but we know that we
        have to make it possible for people to interop with old code, and with DX.&#160; At
        the very least, you will be able to host another hwnd window that is written using
        GDI/User or DX.&#160; The details on when and how DX will get accelerated, and how
        it will play with the rest of the system are still TBD.&#160; At the very least, when
        you go full screen with DX you will own the device.
    </p>

        For simple 3D stuff (load up a model and spin it around like a 3D icon) we will have
        our own 3D API that doesn't pretent to offer all of the flexibility of D3D.
    </p>
    <p>
        What specific scenarios are you interested in?&#160; My thinking is that you might
        want to write a tool and have the UI done with Avalon and the "canvas" of the tool
        done via D3D.&#160; In this scenario, you are in a windowed situation and Avalon is
        on top.&#160; The 3D stuff is running in a window in an Avalon app.&#160; Another
        scenario that might be interesting is that you have a D3D app/game and you are using
        Avalon to drive 2D type UI inside of the game environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can't promise that all of the scenarios will be doable, but let me know what is
        most important to you.
