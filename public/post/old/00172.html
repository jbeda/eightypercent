        Somebody named Cash posted a comment asking about my DIY HT Screen.&#160; Here is
        what I did: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Built a 2"x4" frame the size of my screen.&#160; It is a simple rectangle with a supporting
            member in the middle.&#160; I used some screws and metal "fasteners" to make all of
            the right angles. 
        </li>
        <li>
            A friend came over and helped me mount it to the wall.&#160; I did this by securing
            a 2"x4" in to studs in the wall.&#160; I then put small blocks screwed to the back
            of my frame.&#160; The small blocks were then set on top of the 2"x4" on the wall
            and shimmed until the frame was level on the wall.&#160; I also put some blocks of
            wood in the bottom corners to support the bottom. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the frame was level and where I wanted it on the wall I screwed it in to the
            2"x4" that was already attached to the wall. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then put a piece of hardboard (cut by Home Depot) on top of the frame.&#160; This
            is essentially pegboard without the holes.&#160; It is smooth enough and works pretty
            well.&#160; I screwed this around the edges. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then primed and painted the hardboard screen.&#160; 2 coats of primer and 2 coats
            of matte "Misty Evening."&#160; This is a color suggested by <a href="http://avsforum.com">avsforum.com</a>.&#160;
            I used a small can of "Evermore Interior Latex Flat" paint.&#160; The label has code
            "30BG 64/036" next to the Misty Evening name, if that helps.&#160; This was all applied
            with a very fine roller and let dry. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then built a mitered frame out of good quality (no warping) 1"x4"s.&#160;&#160;We
            wrapped these in black material&#160; and stapled it on the back.&#160; I used black
            felt, but I think that black velvet would be better if you can find a cheap source.&#160;
            I then used finish nails to secure this around the edge of the screen and hide all
            of the screw heads.&#160; I punched the nails in and they are now hidden&#160;behind
            the fabric. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The result is probably overbuilt and not as great as a grayhawk screen, but the price
        can't be beat and it looks pretty darn professional.&#160; The black border really
        helps. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me know if you have any questions or want any pictures!&#160; I don't want to
        take it apart or anything :)
