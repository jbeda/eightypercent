        My <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/18.html#a185">entry</a> pointing
        to our WinHEC slides resulted in links from quite a few sites and a ton of hits.&#160;
        Top among these was an article on <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/05/23/1737226.shtml?tid=109&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=190&amp;tid=201">Slashdot</a>.&#160;
        Also notable are links from <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=7134">OSNews</a>&#160;and <a href="http://www.joeuser.com/index.asp?AID=16309&amp;u=0">Brad
        Wardell (joeuser.com)</a>.&#160; In the last year my blog has gotten 20k hits (not
        counting RSS reads).&#160; In the last day it has gotten something like 25k hits.&#160;
        I'm sure that most of those 25k people won't be back to read this entry, but I'll
        respond anyway. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I appreciate the attention and I've been trying to keep up with all of the comments.&#160;
        Here are some notes and responses: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First off, I can't answer every question.&#160; I have no desire to get in to a flame
            war over specific details or comparisons. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232376">Avalon's
            relationship to Direct3D</a>:&#160; I tried to make this clear in the slides, but
            it is worth repeating.&#160; We are building a managed presentation and UI layer on
            top of Direct3D.&#160; While we will be exposing a 3D API, it is meant to round out
            the UI story and integrate well with our 2D API.&#160; If you are doing super complex
            3D stuff (FPS games), or want access to the latest and greatest Direct3D features,
            Direct3D is the way to go.&#160; If you want to mix a little 3D in with your 2D, Avalon's
            3D APIs will let you do that in a painless way. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232430">Do
            we really need the eye candy?</a>: This has been a popular topic ever since we started
            planning and talking about Avalon.&#160; I'm planning on posting something on this
            later to start the discussion.&#160; My short take: I think that providing more capability
            in the platform is a good thing that will make Windows a more attractive place to
            write applications.&#160; I think that it will also allow our stock user experience
            (Aero and the shell team) and application developers to push the limits and interact
            with users in fundamentally better ways.&#160; However, with power comes responsibility.&#160;
            We are working on a set of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/ux/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaero/html/samplerintro.asp">guidelines</a> (these
            are the Aero user interface guidelines) to help application authors use this stuff
            in a consistent way. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232485">The
            3D bar graph demo is useless</a>: I admit, this <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/06.html#a182">example</a> is
            useless as is.&#160; In a <em>real</em> application there will be a lot more UI about
            picking what data you want to look at and how you want to look at it.&#160; The position
            and view of the 3D graph would probably be controlled by the mouse so that you can
            rotate things around to see hidden data.&#160; There would probably be different types
            of graphs that you would switch between.&#160; However, this was meant as a demo application
            that we threw together in a couple of days.&#160; While the application is a demo,
            the platform that it is running on is real.&#160; There should be nothing stopping
            someone from building a more industrial strength really usable version of this. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232540">We
            are behind the ball on 64 bit</a>:&#160; While Windows had been compiling and shipping
            (well, in beta to be clear) on 64 bit for quite a while (we handed out ia64 and x64
            versions of Longhorn at WinHEC and via MSDN) the real call to action here was to IHVs.&#160;
            Remember this&#160;was the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference.&#160; IHVs have
            limited resources wrt writing drivers and we want to encourage them to write and maintain
            64 bit drivers.&#160; This was one of the big pushes for the conference as a whole.&#160;
            We don't want 64 bit uptake to be slowed down by lack of driver support. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232633">The
            longhorn requirements are crazy</a>: I don't know where the requirements listed here
            came from, but I haven't seen that list.&#160; Obviously we won't see that on a laptop!&#160;
            There are a couple of things to note here.&#160; 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, we will run in software and on lower end machines.&#160; Things may run slower,
                    but it will run.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second, we are going to offer multiple experiences based on hardware capabilities
                    and user preferences.&#160; This ranges from a classic view, to Aero to Aero Glass.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third, the current minimum requirement for Aero Glass is a DX9 class card with 64MB
                    of video memory.&#160; More video memory will be required for higher resolutions or
                    multiple monitors.&#160; We also require the GPU to support PS 2.0 and have a LDDM
                    (Longhorn Device Driver Model) driver. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fourth, as for processor requirements, most of the time when we have, in the past,
                    required a certain speed processor it has been because that speed has been an indicator
                    of the rest of the components in the machine (bus speed, hard driver speed, memory
                    speed, processor instruction support, etc.)&#160; The idea has been to use that one
                    number&#160;as a <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">heuristic </span>for
                    the "generation" of the machine.&#160; Hell, I've run Win2k3 server on a 400MHz celeron.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, we <em>are</em> really concerned about battery life and are working hard to
                    come up with a scalable user experience for times when battery life is more important
                    than running the GPU at full throttle.&#160; I believe that there are a bunch of slides
                    in Kerry's talk on that. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            (my favorite) <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9233103">"dipshits
            still can't code html/css?"</a>: I never claimed to be an artist, but the CSS in question
            was my attempt to get a little bit funky with the style of my site.&#160; It is on
            purpose.&#160; I assume that it will work in most browsers but, honestly, I only tested
            it with IE and Pocket IE.&#160; I posted a <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=201&amp;mode=thread&amp;pid=9233844#9234182">response</a> to
            this on slashdot but apparently someone <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=201&amp;mode=thread&amp;pid=9234182#9235628">thought
            I wasn't me</a>.&#160; Too funny! 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9235276">The
            whole Apple transparent window thing</a>:&#160; I don't read or comment on patents.&#160;
            However, transparent windows have been around for quite a while.&#160; In the windows
            world, these things were introduced in W2K with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwui/html/layerwin.asp">layered
            window support</a>.&#160; Other OSs may have had something similar earlier. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=7134&amp;offset=15&amp;rows=30#239957">Longhorn
            is just vaporware.</a>&#160; <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=109&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=190&amp;tid=201&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=9232324">I'll
            believe it when it ships in 2017</a>:&#160; I'm not crazy enough to comment on ship
            dates.&#160; I'll leave that to the PR people and the execs.&#160; However, we are
            showing off real code.&#160; We've publicly shipped two builds of Longhorn (the PDC
            and the recent WinHEC build) along with SDKs.&#160; Not everything is done yet and
            it is rough around the edges, but this isn't just slideware. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=7134#239905">Innovation</a>:&#160;
            Innovation is such a loaded word.&#160; Hell, MS probably did more to make it loaded
            than anyone else :).&#160; However, I never used the word on my blog and I don't know
            where the guy who posted this to OSNews.com got it.&#160; It really touched off a
            flamewar there which basically comes down to your definition of innovation.&#160;
            Leaving that aside...&#160; I think that Avalon, and Longhorn in general, puts a lot
            of very interesting features together in an integrated API that will benefit developers
            and end users in very exciting ways.&#160; Use your own definition of innovative to
            parse that last sentence. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Well, hopefully that runs the gamut.&#160; I probably missed some stuff, but I have
        to get some real work done today.
