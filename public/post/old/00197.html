        A couple of buddies of mine (Avi and Ken) both have <a href="http://www.lomography.com/about/">Lomo
        cameras</a> that they shoot with.&#160; For the uninitiated, these are super low tech
        cameras that are mass produced in Russia.&#160; There is no autofocus but instead
        a choice of 4 (count 'em -- four) focus settings.&#160; These cameras are so simple
        and bulletproof, that using them is more of a philosophy than a tool.&#160; The whole
        idea is to experiment and play.&#160; On top of that, the lens isn't sharp corner
        to corner and it has quite a bit if vignetting.&#160; That's okay -- it adds to the
        Lomo look.&#160; If I still shot film, I would pick one of these up right away.&#160;
        I may pick one up anyway.&#160; In essence, these cameras are the anti-digital camera.

        If you aren't willing to go that far, there is the <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/">lensbaby</a>.&#160;
        I have one of these on order.&#160; This is a super simple lens for you SLR.&#160;
        It is a single lens attached to some flexible tubing.&#160; You focus by using your
        fingertips to move the lens in and out.&#160; You can also tilt the focus plane.&#160;
        This lens also has quite a bit of blur and vignetting.&#160; And it works on digital
        SLRs?&#160; This thing is so old school that you have to manually take it apart to
        change the aperture.&#160; Sure, you could get the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 lens cheaper
        -- and it has autofocus and an adjustable apature.&#160; But there is something cool
        about the look and feel of the images form this lens.&#160; Check out some of the
        photos <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/pages/gall_strong.php">here</a>.&#160; (I
        want to post photos but I don't want to steal anybody's images.)
