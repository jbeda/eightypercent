    <p>
        I know it seems hard to believe in this day and age of 300GB hard drives, but I've
        run out of hard drive space.&#160; My plan up until now was to keep a bunch of stuff
        on a <s>RAID 0</s> RAID 1 (RAID0 is simple striping with no redundency. RAID 1 is
        mirrored.) 120GB set of drives.&#160; As that fills up, I've been archiving stuff
        to DVD.&#160; The problem is that I've had to start archiving stuff sooner than I
        thought and I don't trust the DVDs.&#160; In fact, I've gotten read errors on some
        already.&#160; They may be fine for video, but I don't want to archive data on them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm faced with a couple of options.&#160; The first option is to half ass it some
        more and put a couple of more drives into my current computer.&#160; I'm hoping the
        power supply can take it.&#160; I think I can fit them in there but it may be tight.&#160;
        Thank god for serial ATA at least.&#160; I don't think I could fit them in with regular
        old parallel ATA.&#160; A Maxtor 300GB SATA drive is urrently $206 at newegg.&#160;
        300GB more (mirrored) would be a good start, but I'm sure I'd run out of space sooner
        or later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The other options I was thinking about was putting together a storage server and running
        RAID 5 (stripe set with parity -- it spreads the data across multiple drives but duplicates
        some of the data for redundency).&#160; I'd like something that I can grow with so
        I'd like to be able to increase the amount of space for just the cost of more drives.&#160;
        Here is what I came up with: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Computer guts: 
            <ul>
                <li>

                    Tomcat i7210 motherboard</a>&#160;($222)&#160; This is a P4 motherboard with 64bit
                    PCI support. This is the cheapest motherboard with 64bit PCI support I could find.&#160;
                    It also comes with SATA RAID on board if I need it.&#160; Dual gigabit ethernet --
                    yum.

                    good price for a fast processor.&#160; Since I'm going to be doing RAID 5 in software
                    it seems worthwhile to pay for a decent proc.

                    This is a little cage that holds 5 hard drives in the space of 3 5.25" external bays.&#160;
                    It comes with a fan and a "backplane" for all of the drives.&#160; And you get cool
                    blinking lights and such.&#160; There is enough room in the monster case to fit two
                    of these for 10 data drives total.

                    SATA RAID controller card</a> ($204)&#160; This thing can drive 8 SATA hard drives.&#160;
                    That should be enough to get me started.&#160; It uses the host processor for doing
                    the RAID 5 stuff, but it is a lot cheaper than the cards that do RAID 5 in hardware.&#160;
                    Since I'm not all that concerned with speed, the savings should be good enough.&#160;
                    The <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=16-125-005&amp;depa=0">Broadcom
                    card</a> is another option but it is $100 more.&#160; Tom's hardware did an <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20041006/index.html">interesting
                    expriment</a> with these where they drove 32 drives off of one computer.

                    This seems to be a sweet spot in capacity right now. The 250GB drives aren't that
                    much cheaper and the 400GB drives are super expensive.&#160; The Maxtor also comes
                    with a 3 year warranty.

    </ul>

        Total price: <strong>$1913</strong> plus shipping and software.&#160; I'd probably
        run Windows as I think I have a legit copy of SBS 2k3 that MS gave me when I still
        worked there.&#160; It should run Linux fine too if all you want to do is serve files. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With RAID 5 this will give me ~900GB of redundant storage.&#160; I can easily double
        the size with another hard drive cage and a set of drives ($942).&#160; This seams
        like a pretty wild deal to me.&#160; Sure it won't be the fastest thing out there
        but it is pretty darn cheap for a ton of storage.&#160; I probably won't drop the
        money on something like this for a while, so I'm expecting it to just get cheaper. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, am I missing anything?&#160; Is someone going to come out with a turnkey system
        for half the price?&#160; The closest comparable thing I could find where the NAS
        systems that various people are selling.&#160; Nothing could touch this setup on price.&#160;
        I looked at the Apple XServe (I do love blinking lights...) but they start at $6000
        for 1TB and require fiber channel.&#160; Way overkill for me.&#160; There is also
        something like the <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10462">LaCie
        terrabyte drive</a>&#160;($1000).&#160; This seems like an amazingly bad idea to me.&#160;
        They must 4 drives in there.&#160; If one fails you loose all of your data.&#160;
        The chances of loosing all of your data is 4 times as likely. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I like pricing out stuff like this even though I may never buy it :)
