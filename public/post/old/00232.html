        Okay -- when people <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jbeda/231/#231881">ask
        me</a> to update in my comments it has probably been too long. I don't have anything
        super pithy to say, so I guess I'll just use the shotgun approach: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everything is going good with the baby.&#160; Rachel is starting to get big!&#160;
            We are reading to her every night and trying to get our lives in order so that we
            are ready.&#160; We are almost through "The Witch and the Wardrobe." We've been reading
            a chapter each night.&#160; After we are done we will continue reading the rest of
            the <a href="http://www.narnia.com/">Narnia</a> stories out loud&#160;to each other
            and the baby.&#160; I know she can't understand what is going on but I want her to
            know my voice. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We went to Chicago last weekend.&#160; My Sister threw Rachel a baby shower at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/chicagorc/">Ritz-Carlton</a> downtown.&#160;
            The service in the garden was wonderful.&#160; My sister's two girls had an especially
            great time. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I've been buying some cool stuff.&#160; The first is my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/28.html#a224">terabyte
            array</a> for my main computer.&#160; I ended up with five 300GB SATA drives in a
            cage running software RAID 5.&#160; That comes out to ~1.2TB after you factor out
            the redundency.&#160; I didn't get a dedicated machine to keep costs down.&#160; I
            can always do that later and move the drives over.&#160; Everything has been running
            like a champ. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Also to prepare I picked up a Canon <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=145&amp;modelid=10599">SD300</a>.&#160;
            This is an update to our aging <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/s100.html">S100</a> (the
            original digital Elph) point and shoot.&#160; It is amazing how much these things
            have improved.&#160; I loved the S100 but the SD300 is <em>so</em> much better.&#160;
            My favorite feature is that it can do 640x480x30fps movies until the card is full.&#160;
            For short clips there is no reason to get a video camera.&#160; I also ordered a 1GB
            SD card but those are apparently sold out everywhere. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm thinking about getting a new car as the baby approaches.&#160; I want to take
            a serious look at the <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/models/model_overview.asp?ModelName=Element">Honda
            Element</a>.&#160; Having an interior made of rubber that you can hose down sound
            like a good idea with kids. Plus, it is only $21k completely decked out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Between Rachel and me, we've recently read the entire <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=raymond+chandler">Raymond
            Chandler</a> catalog.&#160; I love his writing.&#160; You can just feel vintage LA
            ooze from the pages. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I haven't been taking many photos lately.&#160; I have some more stuff&#160;from the&#160;<a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/27.html">Arizona
            trip</a> that I should post.&#160; I haven't put up any of my slot canyon photos yet.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Work has been going great.&#160; I still can't talk about what I'm working on but
            I really feel like I've made it over the hump of moving to a new environment and I'm
            starting to be really productive.&#160; The contrast between Google and Microsoft
            couldn't be greater (at least from an engineer's point of view).&#160; No meetings
            and few politics means that I spend much more time coding.&#160; I've written more
            code so far at Google than I have in the last year at MS.&#160; (That really isn't
            apples to apples as I spent most of my time in the last year at MS writing specs.)&#160;
            I totally feel like I'm in the loop on my project without having to play political
            games.&#160; I guess that is what happens on smaller teams. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'd love to have some intelligent comment on the whole <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html">AutoLink</a>/<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=smarttags">SmartTags</a> thing
            as I've been around for both.&#160; However, I just don't see a clear cut answer here,
            unlike some.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, <a href="http://uploads.ungrounded.net/content.php?id=206373&amp;name=206373_numanuma.swf&amp;title=Numa%20Numa%20Dance&amp;date=1109739600&amp;quality=b&amp;uj=0&amp;w=500&amp;h=375">Numa
            Numa</a>. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That's it for now.
