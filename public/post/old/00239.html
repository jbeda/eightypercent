    <p>
        The <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/04/14.html#a238">20% BoF session
        at CFP</a> last night was fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most interesting thing for me was the questions about how 20% time works.&#160;
        Hopefully I can repeat some of them and the answers here.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How will this scale as Google gets bigger? </strong>I don't know.&#160; What
        I've seen of Google management is that they are committed to keeping the same atmosphere
        as the company grows.&#160; As problems crop up (and I'm sure they will) I'm sure
        that Google will look for "non-traditional" solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you track this?&#160; What if someone is spending 30% of their time
        on a side project? </strong>There isn't really official tracking of this sort of thing.&#160;
        It really comes down to trust of the employee.&#160; At the end of the day (or year)
        you have to list what you've accomplished for your review.&#160; If you've wasted
        your time then you have nothing to talk about on your review.&#160; Keep in mind that
        failures aren't the same as doing nothing -- valuable knowledge is gained.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you make sure that people are using the time wisely?&#160; How does
        this relate to the goals of the division/group/etc?</strong> Well -- that is just
        it -- you don't know if the time is being used wisely.&#160; You want the engineer
        to do what <em>he/she</em> thinks is the next big thing, not what management thinks.&#160;
        Most people want to do the next cool think that will fire people up both inside and
        outside the company and may end up making Google money.&#160; If you think that the
        best way for you to add value with your 20% time is to slack off and do nothing than
        that really speaks for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What is the goal for this?&#160; Isn't this just a morale booster? </strong>For
        some people I'm sure that this is just a morale booster.&#160; My impression, from
        the short time I've been at Google, is that 20% time is more than that.&#160; Most
        people want to add value by doing stuff that is far easier to do inside someplace
        like Google than anywhere else.&#160; My feeling is that I want to use the time wisely
        to add value in new and unexpected ways for the company.&#160; There is a pretty fluid
        path for these projects, if they show promise, to get funded with full time engineers.&#160;
        That path is critical if a 20% project ends up being super successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Where do you find 20% to spare? I can't cut 20% of my features or slip my
        project by 20%.</strong>&#160; I think that there is more time then you think.&#160;
        If you do "research"&#160;in&#160; a lightweight way like this perhaps you can take
        the time elsewhere.&#160; Also keep in mind that happy engineers are more productive
        engineers.&#160; And stop going to so many meetings -- and if you do have meetings,
        don't allow people to sit in the back and read their email.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What about using 20% time as a reward for exceptional performers?&#160; What
        about&#160;taking away&#160;20% time for&#160;those who don't use it wisely? </strong>I'm
        not a huge fan of these ideas for a couple of reasons.&#160; First, some of the best
        ideas come from people who are looking at something with fresh eyes.&#160; If we make
        it a reward it may be too late to capture that.&#160; As for punishing people, I would
        think that this would have a chilling affect.&#160; We want people to try wacky things
        that no one else has thought of.&#160; Having some missteps is bound to happen and
        we don't want&#160;people to be afraid to experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why 20%?&#160; Why not 50%? or 10%? </strong>I'm not sure.&#160; My guess
        is that either someone took it out of thin air or some math PhD at Google has a proof
        somewhere.&#160; If anyone reads this and knows I'd love to here the answer.
    </p>

        <strong>How do you allocate the time?&#160; Is it one day a week?&#160; 1.6 hours
        a day? 2 weeks a year and a weekend a month? </strong>From what I've seen so far,
        it is up to the engineer to figure this out.&#160; People can save it up and use it
        a month at a time if they like.&#160; My personal strategy is to spend some a week
        or two really getting some momentum behind something and then switching to a more
        integrated schedule.&#160; As project hit shipping mode and such these things may
        take a back seat while the time accrues.&#160; Keep in mind that no one is watching
        over your shoulder with a stopwatch.<br />

        One thing that I want to emphasize (and it came up multiple times last night) is that
        a lot of this comes down to <strong>trust</strong>.&#160; One of the big parts of
        the secret sauce here is that Google really trusts its&#160;engineers and, from what
        I've seen, the engineers live up to those expectations.
