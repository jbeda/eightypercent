    <p>
        Rachel (my wife for those of you not playing along at home) has been struggling to
        get parking passes for our cars.&#160; In our neighborhood in Seattle, you need a
        permit to park on the street for longer than 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        How hard can it be to get this pass?&#160;&#160;The <a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/parking/parkingrpz.htm">website</a>&#160;says
        "to have an application mailed to you, please call (206) 684-5086."
    </p>
    <p>
        The response at that number: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is
        full"<br />
        Two days later: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is full."
    </p>
    <p>
        So Rachel decides that this isn't working and goes downtown, parks (no easy task)
        and treks up to the 37th floor of the Seattle Municipal Tower.&#160; Let me set the
        scene for you.&#160; There are two workers helping citizens with their Traffic Permit
        needs.&#160; There is a third that gets up to help Rachel.&#160; Then there is a rotund
        woman sitting next to a ringing phone.&#160; I wasn't there but I imagine that she
        had an unpleasant look on her face.&#160; Let's call her Bertha.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"I'd like to get my zone parking permit"<br />
        <em>Helpful Dude:</em> "Great!&#160; Do you have your forms filled out and your check
        ready?"<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "No.&#160; I tried calling to get the form but the voice mailbox
        was full."<br />
        <em>Bertha (who chimes in from her chair next to a ringing phone):</em> "Well it isn't
        full now."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "I called twice and it was full both times."<br />
        <em>Bertha: </em>"I just emptied it.&#160; It wouldn't be full if you people didn't
        call so much."<br />
        <em>Rachel: </em>"The website instructed me to call.&#160; Why don't you guys just
        put a PDF of the form on the website so that people don't have to call?"<br />
        <em>Guy in next line: </em>"That sounds like a great idea!"<br />
        <em>Bertha:</em> "Nah, that would never work.&#160; People wouldn't know how to download
        it or they would screw it up and it would just create more work for us."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"All right then.&#160; I'll just get my pass and be on my way.&#160;
        I see that I've done all that I can do here."
    </p>
    <p>
        Seriously folks, I can't make this stuff up.
