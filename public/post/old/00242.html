        I wasn't going to upgrade to Photoshop CS2 because I didn't think that I need it.&#160;
        But that was&#160;before I found out about the new support for High Dynamic Range
        (HDR) and 32 bits per&#160;channel floating point support.&#160; Michael Reichmann
        over at The Luminous Landscape has an <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/hdr.shtml">article</a> talking
        about the new "Merge to HDR".&#160; I was going to how current cameras only handle
        6 stops and all (and what a stop is) but Michael does a good job of that in his article.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm excited about this feature because I think that it will enable me to capture images
        that I haven't been able to before.&#160; I've often shot bracketed exposures with
        the thought that I would merge them together by hand later. The results rarely are
        as good as I imagined when I took the image.&#160; For instance, shooting a sunrise
        of a mountain where the top of the mountain is in the sun but the rest is in shadow
        can be very difficult.&#160; Having a tool that approaches this in a more methodical
        way is exciting.&#160; On top of this, I'm excited by the possibilities of this combined
        with panoramic photography.&#160; Wide angle and pano photography has a problem whereby
        you are taking in so much of a scene that you are much more likely to have parts of
        the image be very bright and others be very dark.&#160; One of the skills that I've
        been developing is the ability to pick a scene where I won't run in to these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, as great as the new Photoshop might be, there are other parts of the digital
        photography system that need to catch up.&#160; The first is on the display side.&#160;
        While the data in a photograph might contain lots of dynamic range, today's displays
        can't show it all.&#160; That is going to change over the next couple of years.&#160;
        On the software side, there is plumbing being laid to support 32bpp through the Windows
        desktop and to the video driver.&#160; (The 3D APIs and graphics cards are support
        a lot of this already because it can be useful in 3D rendering).&#160; The displays
        are going to get better also.&#160; Over the next couple of years, expect to see wide
        gamut and HDR screens coming out.&#160; Sunnybrook is one of the companies that has
        been pioneering this <a href="http://www.sunnybrooktech.com/hdr/index.html">LED based
        display technology</a>.&#160; Where&#160;normal LCD or CRT displays can get a contrast
        ratio of 300-400:1, they claim their LED technology can get 60,000:1.&#160; That means
        the bright spots are brighter and the shadows are darker.&#160; I haven't seen one
        of these displays myself, but I'm super excited by the technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other side that needs to improve is on the image capture side.&#160; I have not
        specific knowledge of any plans from any camera manufacturers, but it is obvious that
        the megapixel race is slowing down.&#160; We are reaching the limits of the glass.&#160;
        Another example is the fact that the new prosumer level Nikon SLRs are still only
        6 megapixel.&#160; It is clear that the camera makers are going to compete on more
        than just the <em>number of pixels</em>.&#160; They will start competing on the <em>quality
        of those pixels</em>. This is going to be very exciting.&#160; We are entering a world
        where digital cameras are not just&#160;matching the abilities of film cameras, but
        they are on the verge of surpassing them.&#160; A camera that can capture higher dynamic
        range and a wider gamut?&#160; Sign me up!
    </p>
    <p>
        The big question in my mind is the print making side of the equation.&#160; When I
        print my photos, I usually send them out (<a href="http://www.whcc.com/">WHCC</a>&#160;or <a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com/">WCI</a>)
        to be printed on a Chromira printer.&#160; This is a printer that uses LEDs to expose
        regular photo paper.&#160; This photo paper is then printed traditionally.&#160; The
        gamut of these devices (and that of the ink jet processes) can be larger than current
        displays but is still fairly limited.&#160; The dynamic range of all of these output
        devices is pretty low compared to what can be done with an emissive display device.&#160;
        The bottom line is that the printing technology isn't keeping up with the rest of
        the system.&#160; What does this mean in the long term?&#160; I'm not sure but we
        will start to see a vast divergence between the quality of an image when displayed
        on a good monitor compared to they quality of an image when printed.
    </p>
    <p>
        It certainly is an exciting time for photography...
