        Annie and I watched a DVD this morning while I was feeding her.&#160; Actually, she
        wasn't paying that much attention, but I was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DVD was <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/">Steve Kossack</a>'s new DVD documenting
        one of his workshops to Yosemite during the winter.&#160; The DVD is what Steve hopes
        will be first of a series: "<span class="style1">Steve Kossack: Photographing the
        Great American Landscape."&#160; This one is titled <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/DVD/index.htm">"Yosemite
        in the&#160;Winter."</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that I have the baby, I don't have the time to go on workshops like this, so this
        is the&#160;next best thing.&#160; If you are interested in landscape photography
        at all, this DVD will be of interest to you.&#160; If you haven't been on a photo
        workshop, the video will give you an idea of what one of those workshops is like --
        without the waking up at 4:30 am to hit a sunrise shoot.&#160; If you are planning
        on doing Yosemite on your own, Steve's DVD will provide an invaluable guide to how
        to approach the area and some great places to shoot.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for Steve himself, I've been on two of his workshops so far (Death Valley and <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/past_ws/past04.htm#landmarks2">Landmarks
        of the Southwest</a>) and both were great.&#160; Steve really knows his stuff -- both
        on the photography side and on the natural and human history of the area.&#160; I've
        never been to Yosemite, but I'd love to go with Steve sometime in the future.
