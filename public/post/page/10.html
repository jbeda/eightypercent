        Since most people who read this weren't there and couldn't ask questions, don't be
        afraid to ask questions here.&#160; I'll either answer them here or try to get an
        answer for you.

    <p>
        While reading these slides, keep in mind that we were targeting hardware people.&#160;
        This was really about letting IHVs know what they can do to prepare for what is coming
        in Longhorn and Avalon.

        <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/">Dan</a> has started a blog where he will
        be talking Avalon 3D.&#160; He is one of the devs that is currently working on this
        part of Avalon.&#160; Even though the Avalon 3D stuff is still early (we aren't feature
        complete yet) he plans on talking through what you <em>can</em> do with the WinHEC
        build.

        Ha! I get linked from a <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=106586&amp;cid=9070786">comment</a> and
        I see a spike in traffic.&#160; Slashdot is <em>the</em> flow machine.&#160; In any
        case, there are some misstatements in that comment that I'd like to answer.&#160;
        First, I'm not "the guy from Microsoft behind Avalon."&#160; Rather I'm one on a large
        team of developers.&#160; My particular area is the graphics APIs.&#160; Avalon is
        much more than just graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, managed code is a different beast that unmanaged code.&#160; While it can
        make programmers more productive and I totally think that it is the way of the future,
        a developer can write bad code in any language.&#160; While right now I don't think
        that anyone would claim that managed code is faster than unmanaged code, the difference
        is generally not that great.&#160; I've heard of some research that suggests that
        future JITs may be able to apply run time directed optimizations and recompilation
        that <em>could</em> make managed code faster.&#160; But that world isn't here yet.

        I'm done with my part of helping make WinHEC a success.&#160; My talk went off pretty
        well and we got some great questions and comments.&#160; I also worked the booth and
        showed&#160;industry and press people what Longhorn can do.&#160; The big news for
        the WinHEC release is that we now have a start to our 3D APIs.&#160; We had a couple
        of examples that show mixing 3D and 2D in a seamless way.&#160; I tried to go out
        of my way to make sure that everyone knew that Avalon was much more than just graphics.&#160;
        We are a full UI platoform that includes controls, styling, databinding, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main demo I was showing was a simulated "blood sugar tracker."&#160; It essentially
        has a 3D bar graph in the background that slowly rotates.&#160; Layered on that are
        semi-transparent buttons.&#160; There is also a details panel that can come up that
        is semi-transparent and has another 3D scene hosted inside of it.&#160; We have a
        vector graphic doctor icon in the corner that you can zoom in on to see that it is
        rasterized at the device resolution.&#160; The really impressive thing here is that
        our demo team (a dev and a designer) took 2-3 days to turn this from an email idea
        into reality.&#160; Robert and <a href="http://longhornblogs.com/ndunlap/">Nathan</a> did
        a great job of showing the power of Avalon.&#160; Here is a screen shot:

        I should have posted this earlier, but better late than never.&#160; I'm going to
        be speaking at WinHEC.&#160; It'll be session TW04006: Avalon Graphics - 2D, 3D, Imaging
        and Composition.&#160; If you are there and are interested in Avalon come check it
        out.&#160; I'll be going in to some detail on what happens between when a developer

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00180.html">Stress duty</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Mon, Apr 12, 2004</span>
        <div class="post">
          <p>

    <p>
        Here in Windows (and in other groups around the company) we have a system that is
        generally called stress.&#160; Different groups have different implementations, but
        the idea is always the same.&#160; You develop a test suite that hammers you system
        and&#160;then have everyone install it and run it overnight.&#160; The idea is that
        this way we can catch those hard to repro issues that only our customers see. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When you get one of these errors, what do you do with it?&#160; Generally there is
        a team of people who have the thankless job of coming in early, finding all the machines
        that have broken in to the debugger, logging the failures in a database and having
        the system send mail to various people to investigate.&#160; The actual debugging
        is done via the NT command line debugger (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/ddk/debugging/default.mspx">cdb</a>)
        redirected over the network via the remote.exe utility.&#160; It is up to this team
        to figure out which issues have already been caught and fixed (but perhaps aren't
        in the build yet) and what issues are new and need to be investigated.&#160; These
        guys cover a lot of code so the generally don't have the knowledge to figure out what
        developer should be looking at any particular problem.&#160; That falls to the rotating
        list of people who are on "stress duty."&#160; The shell team calls it "dev of the
        day."&#160; We've learned by hard experience that if you send these types of things
        to a big mailing list, they either get ignored or the same sorry glutton for punishment
        picks up all of the issues. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I happen to be on stress duty this week.&#160; My job is to handle, in as expedient
        a fashion as possible, any incoming issues.&#160;&#160;I&#160;have to do my best to
        exercise&#160;my debugging skills and try to figure out what is going on.&#160; BTW, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond
        Chen</a> is one of the undisputed masters of the cdb kung-fu.&#160; If I can figure
        out what is going on myself, I can file a bug on the issue and let the person whose
        machine I'm debugging reclaim their machine.&#160; If the problem is in code that
        I don't know well it is my job to reassign the issue to someone who does know the
        code well.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond handling incoming stress breaks in the morning, I also have to be responsive
        to all sorts of other issues that might get dropped on the floor.&#160; This includes
        other random crashes people might have during the day along with helping out to resolve
        any build breaks.&#160; (We try super hard to make sure that build breaks don't happen,
        but with something the size of Windows it still sometimes happens.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Do other companies have systems like this set up?&#160; I'd be interested to hear
        what works for you.

        In case you haven't seen it, part of my interview that I did with <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com">Scoble</a>&#160;is
        up at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com">Channel9</a>.&#160; [BTW, big congrats to
        the Channel9 guys.&#160; The site looks great and it survived being slashdotted on
        its first day.&#160; How many dynamic sites do you know can handle a load like that
        so soon after launch?]
    </p>
    <p>
        I did a long interview with Scoble and he asked me a lot of questions. It is interesting
        that he the topic of "Is Avalon a way to take over the Web" is the first that they
        put up there.&#160; I'm glad that it is though as this is definately a hot button
        topic.&#160; I'll be sure to keep an eye on the comments on the video and answer any
        questions that you guys have. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A little background on me: I joined the IE group at Microsoft in the middle of 1997
        right out of college.&#160; I'd interned twice -- once on a forgotten product called
        TeamManager and the second time on the OpenGL inside of Windows.&#160; When working
        on IE, I was responsible for, mostly, the data model for how we stored HTML in memory
        for processing and rendering.&#160; I touched a lot of other code, but my original
        nickname was "Tree Boy" (to <a href="http://www.ericvasilik.com/">Eric Vasilik's</a> "Tree
        Man" :)&#160; If you have questions on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=IMarkupServices">IMarkupServices</a>,
        I can probably answer them for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A couple of years ago, I moved over to the then (very newly) formed Avalon Media Integration
        Layer and helped define the early vision of what we were going to do with 2D UI level
        graphics in Longhorn. (The DX team is all over 3D and games!)&#160; At one point all
        we knew that we wanted was CFS, which stood for "Cool Flying Stuff".&#160; We upgraded
        thaet to "Clickable Flying Stuff" and the graphics strategy for Avalon was born.&#160;
        Since then I've been hard at work helping to define and implement a lot of the graphics
        functionality in Longhorn.&#160; Seriously, I think that we are making a huge leap
        ahead for Windows and look forward to helping everyone understand what we are about.&#160;
        I'm also interested in hearing comments, suggestions and bug reports.
