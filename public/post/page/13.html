        If you are at all interested in photography, you might want to try out a workshop.&#160;
        I went on one to Death Valley last year with Steve Kossack.&#160; He knows the area
        like the back of his hand and runs a great workshop.&#160; You get up before dawn
        to shoot the sunrise, take it easy during the afternoon and then stay up past sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/workshops/sk-dv-03.shtml">Here</a>&#160;is
        a page describing the upcoming workshop March 4-8.&#160; I'm actually in the first
        picture on that page (second from the left).&#160; If you end up doing it, let Steve
        know I sent you!

        If you haven't noticed, I've haven't been posting in a while!&#160; I don't know about
        you, but I've been in a little bit of a funk after the PDC.&#160; It was really exciting
        but now it is back to life as usual. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, as a Christmas present for me and Rachel, I'm turning our basement room
        (23'x13'x9') in to a home theater.&#160; We aren't doing anything super elaborate,
        but I figured I'd put out what I'm doing to see if anyone has comments:

        We are planning on getting some new furniture down there along with painting the walls

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00153.html">Avalon, XAML and SVG</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Tue, Nov 4, 2003</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        There has been a ton of speculation on SVG and its relationship (or lack thereof)
        to Avalon.&#160; Here is some thoughts on that, collected from various responses I've
        made or others have made. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Our rendering model is very much like that of SVG.&#160; We support a hierarchical
            compositing model with transforms that affect items in the hiearchy. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Our markup isn't the same mostly because XAML is a direct reflection of the programming
            model.&#160; There is a very solid relationship between the markup and the objects
            and methods. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Our OM doesn't match the SVG DOM because we choose to go with an object model that
            more closely matches what we think <em>our</em> users expect.&#160; Specifically,
            we tried hard to make sure that our object model provided a certain amount of consistency
            with WinForms (and VB and MFC before it)&#160;and ASP.Net.&#160; Beyond this, our
            object model is strongly typed where much of the SVG DOM is based around strings.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            WVG is a term that we are no longer using and isn't, in my opinion, very useful.&#160;
            We were supposed to have scrubbed this from our documentation, but apparently we missed
            some stuff.&#160; There is no strick subset of Avalon objects and XAML markup that
            stands on its own with respect to vector graphics.&#160; 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Whereas when using SVG inside of XHTML there is a very&#160;bright line, when using
                    a vector graphic element in a UI authored in XAML, there is no sharp line.&#160; You
                    can put a Rectangle element, for example, in flow with a document without a Canvas
                    element.&#160; To do a similar thing with XHTML/SVG, you would need to wrap all SVG
                    content in an SVG element.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Avalon, the set of properties and property types is the same between vector graphics
                    elements and other elements.&#160; In this way the background property for a Button
                    is of type Brush -- the same as the fill property for a Rectangle. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are elements that can very easily be seen to belong to both a control subset
                    and a vector graphics subset.&#160; For example, Image makes sense in a UI sense but
                    also in a VG sense.&#160; XHTML and SVG both have image elements.&#160; We avoid this
                    duplicity.&#160; Text is another area where we avoid a large amount of duplication. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            While we share a rendering model with SVG to a large extent, our support and features
            don't match up completely.&#160; Some of it is stuff that we haven't implemented yet
            and others are due to choices that we've made because of programming model concerns.&#160;
            I'll try to put together a guide on this stuff at some point in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I'm sure there are questions around SVG and XAML/Avalon that I haven't answered here.&#160;
        Post in the comments and I'll update this post with the latest and greatest.

        Actually, I'm proud of the work that we are doing on Avalon, but I hate the name.&#160;
        It just sounds lame and dorky to me.&#160; I guess this is what you get when you vote
        on a code name.&#160; Aero and Indigo are much better names.&#160; In fact, the shell
        team has the best code names:&#160;Aero, Jade, Luna, Plex.&#160; I guess it is because
        they have designers who are creative types.
    </p>
    <p>
        The worst code name I can think of right now was for NT4.&#160; It started out being
        just and update to the shell.&#160; So, it was called the "Shell Update Release" that
        got abbreviated SUR.&#160; They even made T-Shirts that said "We don't need any stinkin'
        code name."
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyone haved examples of other really bad code names for projects?

        There are some questions that have been coming up pretty often, so I want to put together
        a series of posts addressing these.&#160; I don't have time to do this now, but I
        wanted to pull together the questions.&#160; Here is what I have so far?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            SVG vs. XAML?&#160; What up with that?&#160; Why are you guys different?&#160; How
            can I translate stuff back and forth?</li>
        <li>
            Will I get to write pixel shaders?</li>
        <li>
            What kind of color support are you going to have?</li>
        <li>
            Should I write my custom control using control composition with shapes, or should
            I be overriding Render or should I start creating Visuals?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Are there any others you guys want answered?
