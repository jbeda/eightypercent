        Apparently, man <em>cannot</em> live (long) by bread alone, according to <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_209.html">this

        I'm packing up to move back to Seattle, so don't expect a lot of posting over the

        Telecommuting was fun, but I'm really feeling out of the loop at work.&#160; I miss
        my friends and living in a big(ger) city.&#160; I'm looking forward to everything
        except the real commute across 520 every day.&#160; Oh well, I guess you have to take
        the good with the bad.

        I freakin' hate ticketmaster.&#160; I just had to buy a baseball ticket -- just one
        as we have another person going to the game.&#160; The base ticket price is $16 but
        the total ended up being $22.81.&#160; That is a 43% service charge.&#160; That is
        more than I pay in income tax. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond this, I had to actually use the phone instead of doing it online because I
        wanted to get a seat as close to my other tickets.&#160; In addition to ripping me
        off they: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Asked for my email address to send me confirmation and then asked me if it is okay
            to sign me up to some random&#160;spam list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to sports illustrated. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to entertainment weekly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to entice me to some other offer that I didn't catch because the poor guy in
            their phone center was mumbling. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Selling tickets can't be that hard a business to run.&#160; Are these guys just money
        hungry?

        I got some email from someone who calls himself "RAD Moose" (blogs offline...) on
        an easier way to take a snapshot from a video file.&#160; This might come in handly
        later.&#160; Here it is: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Open WindowsMovieMaker2 (feature not in WMM1) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Import Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll thru movie in Preview Window 
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "Take Picture From Preview Window" item in Tools Menu 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Very cool!&#160; I'll have to download Movie Maker 2 and give this a try!

        I just don't get the excitement around 802.11a and 802.11g standards.&#160; Sure --
        5 times as fast would be nice, but in reality, I'm not using my wireless connection
        for anything that requires faster speeds.&#160; God knows my broadband connection
        can't keep up with 11Mbps.&#160; And if I do (like copying GBs of photos around) I
        just plug in to an ethernet cable. I know, eventually we'll get video on demand and
        all sorts of other high end services over these wireless links.
    </p>
    <p>
        802.11b strikes a great balance of speed and range.&#160; The build-out is happening.&#160;
        Why is the press trying to make such a big deal of it?&#160; Or is it not the press
        and there are people who are&#160;really excited about this stuff?
    </p>
    <p>
        (10Gb ethernet might be more interesting as this means the network is approaching
        bus speeds.)

        I was busting a gut on this.&#160; They even say "Moo" at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Getting that snapshot of the video was a total PITA.&#160; Because of video overlays,
        PrintScreen didn't work.&#160; I had to turn off all of the video acceleration features
        via the display control panel so that the video went through the normal display pipeline.&#160;
        Overlays suck -- and they don't work with a desktop compositor.&#160; <em>Hint, hint</em>.)
