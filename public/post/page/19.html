        I finally cleaned up my blogging software enough to release the source and an install
        package.&#160; There is a screenshot <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/05/03.html#a88">here</a>.
        I'm releasing this as 0.9.0.

        <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-src-0.9.0.zip">Source</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've installed the binaries, there is a readme on what to do next installed
        into the programs directory.&#160; You have to copy some stuff around and edit some
        xml files to configure what is going on.&#160; If any of this is unclear, let me know
        and I'll update the readme.&#160; The readme is <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/Readme-0.9.0.txt">here</a> also. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the basic architecture: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All data exists in <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger</code>.&#160; If you want
            to back up your site, this is the thing to back up. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Config/Site1.Config</code> is a private config
            file with various file paths and FTP server information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> is everything that gets uploaded
            to the server.&#160; This includes the raw XML source data and the generated html
            files.&#160; If you have images or other files in that directory also, they will get
            uploaded for you. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1/Config/Site.Config</code> contains public
            config information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            When publishing the client generates the site into the <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> dir
            and then uploads that to the FTP server. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Play around with it, send me any deltas you have and spread the word!

        I hate New York.&#160; It isn't just the Yankees.&#160; It is the snide attitude that
        nothing else matters.&#160; Dave Winer, today, has an <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/05/07#When:8:41:06PM">entry</a> today
        that smacks of the same self-righteousness:&#160; 
    </p>
    <blockquote>"Basically the rule is that success breeds envy, and envy isn't that far
    from hate." </blockquote> 
    <p>
        While I think that this sentiment is true, I think that the bigger reason that people
        hate him is that he is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=dsm+bipolar&amp;spell=1">Bipolar</a> whiner.
        I've never had an email exchange with him where he doesn't take his toys and go home.
    </p>
    <p>
        By Dave's own criteria, the only reason people hate Microsoft is because we are so
        successful.&#160; In the ancient <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews">essay</a> that
        he points to he makes this argument (with BillG) directly.&#160; However, he has changed
        his tune over the last couple of years.&#160; I'm pretty sure that he wouldn't write
        the same thing now.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "they only hate me because I'm successful" arguement may be some of why MS is
        such a focus for animosity, but I (and a lot of other people at Microsoft) think that
        the problem is deeper than that -- it is one of the ways the company has changed over
        the last couple of years.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        If Dave really beleives what he wrote, he is guilty of the same hubris of which he
        accuses us.

        It is getting on to time for me to look for a new car.&#160; I was pretty settled
        on a <a href="http://www.bmwusa.com/site_layout/models/0328/0328_mdlPage.cfm">Z4 3.0i
        w/ SMG</a>&#160;but the new <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/FutureModelHomePage/0,3210,24842,00.html">350Z
        Roadster</a> is looking pretty sweet.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking at picking it up sometime in September, but I want to plan ahead.&#160;
        I was going to avoid the 350Z Roadster because of the typical new car feeding frenzy
        but it looks like availability might not be that bad.&#160; However, if I get the
        Z4, I can pick it up in Spartanburg, NC.

        I just feel sorry for <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/04/29/star_war.shtml">this</a> kid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, the story (23rd hand, probably) is this:&#160; This kid used a school camera
        to video tape his star wars fighting skills.&#160; He forgot to take the tape out
        and someone else found it.&#160; I've mirrored the original video <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/Star_Wars_Kid.wmv">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It wasn't long before somebody on the net remixed it by adding appropriate sounds
        and special effects.&#160; I've mirrored that <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/Star_Wars_Kid_Remix.wmv">here</a> also.

        <div class="post">

    <p>
        I was finally able to find time to put true WYSIWYG HTML editing into JoeBlogger.
        Here is a current screenshot:<br />
        <img src="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger3.JPG" /> 
        <br />
        Notice that there is no save button.&#160; Just start a new entry and hit Upload.&#160;
        It FTPs everything that has changed to your site on a background thread. If you don't
        hit upload, it will automatically save your unpublished entry.&#160; I really like
        the UI model with no explicit "save" functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        I stole the HTML editing control code (which is really a wrapper around IE's rendering
        engine: Trident) from <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's</a> <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a">BlogX</a>.&#160;
        He stole it from Nikhil Kothari&#160;who wrote it originally&#160;<a href="http://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a> <a href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/default.aspx?tabindex=4&amp;tabid=46">WebMatrix</a> project.&#160;
        The HTML -&gt; XHTML conversion code was written by Andrew Lin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that JoeBlogger is a very different project than BlogX.&#160; BlogX is a client/server
        solution that has the canonical data store on the server.&#160; It requires a ASP.Net
        server to run the server side part (Actually, you could probably write a different
        server that expose the same API, but you get the idea).&#160; JoeBlogger is a client
        side only solution that doesn't have <em>any</em> server side code at all.&#160; All
        of the pages are generated on the client and uploaded to the server.&#160; As long
        as you have FTP access to your web server (and almost everyone does) you are set. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in getting&#160;a look at the JoeBlogger source, let me know
        and I can give you an early drop of the source.&#160; I'll probably add some more
        features (and a decent setup) and then release it.

        I'd like to switch to a new ISP. Here is what I'm looking for: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reasonable rates. I'm thinking ~$20/month tops. 
        </li>
        <li>
            ASP.Net hosting 
        </li>
        <li>
            500Mb to 1Gb of space. I'd like to be able to put a lot of pictures up there. 
        </li>
        <li>
            No frills support 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reasonable access to log files. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It seems like there are a ton of LAMP shops out there offering a deal like this but
        I can't find anything that will host ASP.Net. Anyone know anything I don't? Do i have
        to get a bunch of friends together and colocate a box? Most places look like they
        really rip you on extra storage space. If I can't find anything good then I may drop
        the ASP.Net requirement and do most everything client side and FTP static pages up
        like I'm doing now. 
    </p>
