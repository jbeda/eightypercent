    <p>
        The second thing that happened today is that we released <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">libjingle</a> on
        sourceforge.&#160;Full details are up on the <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-all-way.html">Talk
        blog</a>&#160;and at <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-bells.html">code.google.com</a>.
        Sean Egan (of Gaim fame) packaged up the code that Talk uses to do p2p as a library
        for others to use.&#160; Hopefully this will start a flood of interoperable voice
        (and other p2p applications).&#160; So that anyone can use it the code is released
        under a berkeley style license. Sean put together some great docs on how to use the
        new library <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing to keep in mind -- we haven't harmonized the specs and libjingle yet.&#160;
        The goal is to have libjingle implement the spec as it matures.&#160; Right now it
        just interoperates with Talk and is pretty far from the Jingle docs that the JSF released.&#160;
        As the spec moves forward the code will converge.&#160; Most of the differences right
        now are syntax.&#160; For example the underlying technique for punching through NATs
        is unchanged and is an adaptation of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-06.txt">ICE</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've wanted to release this core part of the Talk application for a long time now
        and I'm super excited to see it happen. The combination of these new standards and
        the libjingle library should be pretty potent.&#160; And since&#160;Jingle can be
        used for more than just voice, I'm sure we'll see this stuff used in interesting and
        surprising ways that we never envisioned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Update12/17/2006: Clarified how divergent spec/code are and pointed to ICE.

        We've been working with the Jabber community to&#160;standardize the P2P protocols

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00259.html">Converting Digicam Video</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Mon, Dec 12, 2005</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        For serious portraits or low light situations, we've been taking lots of pictures
        of Annie with my Canon 20D.&#160; I also have a Canon SD300 for convience and video.&#160;
        The video modes on these small cameras are amazing!&#160; I can't see myself needing
        more than a couple minutes of video.&#160; Who needs a video camera for their kids
        these days? 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, dealing with the video out of these things can be tricky.&#160; I post my
        pictures to <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">smugmug.com</a> (if you sign up use
        my referrer coupon: <span class="title">aoVCSFuPXSipF</span>).&#160; I've got a plan
        that also lets me upload videos.&#160; The only format they take is MPEG 1 (for compat
        reasons)&#160;but the camera produces MJpeg AVI files.&#160; Converting these things
        can be trickier than you'd think.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is what I've ended up doing -- if someone else has a better solution let me know. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download 'MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre7.zip' from <a href="http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/win32-beta/">here</a>&#160;[7.8M].
            There are a lot of distributions out there but most of the older ones don't work for
            some reason.&#160; This one at least does something reasonable. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Unzip this into a directory.&#160; I put it under an MPlayer dir in my "program files"
            dir. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a batch file with this in it (call it <code>convert-avi.cmd</code> or something):<pre>@echo off
setlocal

set CL="c:\Program Files\MPlayer\mencoder"
set CL=%CL% -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of mpeg -mpegopts format=mpeg1
set CL=%CL% -af lavcresample=44100 -vf hqdn3d,harddup -srate 44100
set CL=%CL% -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg1video:keyint=15:vrc_buf_size=1000
set CL=%CL%:vrc_maxrate=2500:vbitrate=2500:trell:mbd=2:vrc_init_cplx=1000 
set CL=%CL% -ni -nobps 
set CL=%CL% -o %~n1.mpg %1
%CL%</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Call your brand new batch file with the <code>.avi</code> file you need to convert.&#160; It will
            create a file in the current directory with the same name but a <code>.mpg</code> extension.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This command line is totally out of control.&#160; I couldn't find a way to wrap lines
        in batch files so I did the environment variable trick.&#160; I got this via trail
        and error and I'm not sure what all of the options mean, but here is what I know it
        does: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Encodes as MPEG 1 into a .mpg file 
        </li>
        <li>
            Upconverts the audio to 44.1 kHz as that is the only freq I could get to work. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't do any resizing or framerate changes (leaves it at 640x480x30fps for my files) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses a fairly high bitrate to make sure the quality stays good 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For a 18.5 second video doing this compression (just to MPEG1 -- let alone something
        better) cut&#160;a 35M AVI file down to 5.5M.&#160; The only problem I haven't figured
        out is that the first frame is really pixelated.&#160; If you can figure it out you
        win my undying gratitude.&#160; Check out the docs&#160;<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/index.html#toc">here</a> or <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Bonus:</strong> You can rotate the&#160;video during the conversion with a <code>,rotate=90</code> on
        the after <code>harddup</code> on the -vf argument. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, check out a cute video of Annie <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/MVI_0478.mpg">here</a>.

        I <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/09/02.html">left Microsoft for
        Google</a> one year ago today.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've got to be honest; it was a little scary when I left.&#160; I started at Microsoft
        right out of college after two internships.&#160; Up until a year ago, the lion's
        share of my professional experience had been at Microsoft.&#160; Microsoft can be
        a very comfortable place (much less so since they've been cutting benefits).&#160;
        From the outside, I've also been able to look at Microsoft with different eyes.&#160;
        What I used to rationalize away now appears <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001835.php">absurd
        on the face</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is one year&#160;later and I'm sure that I made the right decision.&#160; I've
        been much happier over the last year at Google.&#160; I'm sure some of it was the
        excitement of just doing something different, but a lot of it really came from the
        energy of those I work with and actually <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249">shipping
        product</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, and my non-compete and non-solicit contracts with Microsoft have now expired.&#160;
        If you are looking for new challenges feel free to send me a resume.

    <p>
        There have been a lot of questions around Google's approach to federation -- both&#160;in
        the comments on this blog and in other forums (the jdev list, slashdot, etc).&#160;
        I apologize for the delay in responding to these questions head on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We've updated our FAQ to clarify some changes.&#160; To save everyone having to look
        it up in the Google cache, here is the before: 
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1">We look forward to federating with any service provider
    who shares our belief in enabling user choice and open communications. We do believe,
    however, that it is important to balance openness with ensuring that we maintain a
    safe and reliable service that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses.
    We are using the federation opportunity with EarthLink and Sipphone to develop a set
    of guidelines by which all members of the federated network can work together to ensure
    that we protect our users while maximizing the reach of the network. [...]</font></blockquote> 
    <p>
        Here is the new text (changes in red): 
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><strong style="COLOR: red">We plan to support open server-to-server
    federation.</strong> We do believe, however, that it is important to <strong style="COLOR: red">have
    the safeguards in place</strong> to ensure that we maintain a safe and reliable service
    that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses. We are using the federation
    opportunity with EarthLink, Sipphone <strong style="COLOR: red">and other partners</strong> to

    of the federated network can work together to ensure that we protect our users while
    maximizing the reach of the network. [...]</font></blockquote> 
    <p>
        On top of that, one of my fellow Google Talk developers, Gary Burd,&#160;has introduced
        himself to the Jabber developer mailing list.&#160; You can read his first post <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2005-August/021792.html">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I, personally, look forward to a long and fruitful partnership between Google and
        the Jabber community.

        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        Annie and I watched a DVD this morning while I was feeding her.&#160; Actually, she
        wasn't paying that much attention, but I was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DVD was <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/">Steve Kossack</a>'s new DVD documenting
        one of his workshops to Yosemite during the winter.&#160; The DVD is what Steve hopes
        will be first of a series: "<span class="style1">Steve Kossack: Photographing the
        Great American Landscape."&#160; This one is titled <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/DVD/index.htm">"Yosemite
        in the&#160;Winter."</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that I have the baby, I don't have the time to go on workshops like this, so this
        is the&#160;next best thing.&#160; If you are interested in landscape photography
        at all, this DVD will be of interest to you.&#160; If you haven't been on a photo
        workshop, the video will give you an idea of what one of those workshops is like --
        without the waking up at 4:30 am to hit a sunrise shoot.&#160; If you are planning
        on doing Yosemite on your own, Steve's DVD will provide an invaluable guide to how
        to approach the area and some great places to shoot.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for Steve himself, I've been on two of his workshops so far (Death Valley and <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/past_ws/past04.htm#landmarks2">Landmarks
        of the Southwest</a>) and both were great.&#160; Steve really knows his stuff -- both
        on the photography side and on the natural and human history of the area.&#160; I've
        never been to Yosemite, but I'd love to go with Steve sometime in the future.

        Microsoft.&#160; It is more forward looking than a lot of the other MS conferences.]
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to the PDC to keep up with what is going on with Windows.&#160; Drop me
        a line if you'd like to chat about Google Talk or anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not sure which sessions I'm going to attend yet, but I can tell you that my interests
        have shifted somewhat since I've shipped software on the outside.&#160; I'm much more
        interested in stuff that can help make Google Talk better now than more forward looking
        stuff that may not ship for another year yet.&#160; I'm also a lot less interested
        in huge frameworks that tie my product to Windows.&#160; While Google Talk is right
        now just a Windows only application, we've worked hard to keep the Win32 only stuff
        isolated so that it will be easier for us to port/write on other platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, is anyone working on an Avalon/.Net Jabber/XMPP client?&#160; I've
        been looking at the SSL/TLS support in the WinFX SDK and it might be possible to do
        it without any reliance on external libraries.

    <p>
        There are some other members of the team who have web sites that I'd like to point
        to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.glaak.com/">Gayle Laakmann</a> -- Gayle just joined our team a
            couple of weeks ago, but she has already made her mark. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.brightlycoloredfood.com/">Chad Thornton</a> -- Chad was the main
            designer for Google Talk.&#160; He is one of the reasons that the application has
            such a clean and fresh look. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.rezab.com">Reza Behforooz</a> -- Reza has been working on the
            Google Talk server from the start.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are probably some that I've missed, but I haven't seen their posts yet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        [<strong>Update: </strong>Fixed link to Chad!] 
        <br />
        [<strong>Update:</strong> Added Reza]
    </p>
