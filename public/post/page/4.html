        <span class="lead">Sun, Jul 24, 2005</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        I'm an engineer at heart and I like to understand how things work.&#160; Our new baby, <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/25.html#a244">Anne</a>,
        is no exception.&#160; Let's take a programmers approach to understanding this mysterious
        black box. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Inputs (the 5 senses): 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Sight </strong>Anne certainly likes to look around.&#160; My understanding
            is that babies generally see only high contrast at a pretty short distance (1 foot?)&#160;
            She certainly likes looking at faces close up. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sound </strong>Whitenoise is supposed to be soothing.&#160; She also likes
            U2 and (heaven help me) Cher.&#160; Loud.&#160; I think she likes my singing too.&#160;
            I'm not sure why. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Taste </strong>She eats a lot.&#160; I'm not sure how much variation in taste
            she actually gets.&#160; There are theories that the mother's diet can affect the
            milk, but I haven't personally verified that. <em>Ewwww.</em> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Touch </strong>Babies need to be held and touched.&#160; They also need to
            be warm.&#160; One input is swaddling&#160;-- wrapping her tightly so that she can't
            move her arms or legs. Rocking and dancing with her count here too. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Smell </strong>Smell is supposed to be one of the most powerful senses.&#160;
            I've yet to see her react to any smells specifically, but I'm sure she is paying attention. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Outputs: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Biological Outputs</strong> Doctors are funny creatures.&#160;&#160; They
            are really concerned about all forms of matter escaping from our bodies: liquid, solid
            or gas.&#160; Parents also pay close attention to this.&#160; The amount, type and
            origin seem to be important clues to understanding the baby. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cries </strong>She has many and varied cries.&#160; Some of them are short
            yelps to draw attention while others are reports of murder nearby.&#160; Then there
            is the scary quivering lower lip.&#160; This is supposedly normal and a byproduct
            of her immature nervous system.&#160; It just kills me to see her do it though. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Posture </strong>The way she holds her body is an important clue.&#160; If
            she is curled up like a bug or stretched out and rigid means something. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Eyes and Face </strong>Her eyes and face are very expressive.&#160; Almost
            too expressive.&#160; She goes through a facial expression every 5 seconds or so. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sleep</strong> You'd think that it would be easy to tell if she is asleep
            or not.&#160; It really isn't though.&#160; She can be sleeping with her eyes closed
            or just pretending to sleep so that the minute you put her down she perks right up
            again. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There you have it&#160;-- 5 inputs and 5 outputs.&#160; Sounds like a pretty simple
        system to me.&#160; The problem is that she is indeed a very complex state machine.&#160;
        She is so complex that there is no way to map the effect of the inputs (feeding her,
        for example) to the outputs (her current crying state).&#160; One would think that
        it would be easy to empirically derive causal relationships between certain inputs
        and certain outputs.&#160; Nope. She has more states than a Rubik's cube (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube">43,252,003,274,489,856,000</a>).
        The baby is indeed a very complex creature that does not yield her secrets to such
        a naïve logical approach. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The amazing part is that biology takes over.&#160; My own brain is more complex than
        it can understand.&#160; It has adapted to the baby and somehow we're able make it
        work.&#160; Except when we can't&#160;-- like last night when all of us were up every
        90 minutes.<br />

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00243.html">On Talking to the Media</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Sat, Jun 18, 2005</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        Once in a while I get approached by a reporter (either local newspaper or national
        business magazine) to comment on some story.&#160; I'm really not sure why they&#160;approach
        a B list blogger like me (how long since I last posted?) but it probably has something
        to do with the fact that I'm one of the only bloggers that went from Microsoft to
        Google.&#160; If there is a story that involves Google and Microsoft, my name seems
        to come up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My standard answer to any requests like this is that I can't comment.&#160; Here is
        the mail I sent in response to a message last night: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>Hi XXX, 
    <p>
        As much as I would love to help you out on your story, it is probably best for me
        to not comment on stuff like this. I want to keep my discourse on Microsoft (especially
        compared to my current employer) as positive as possible. I'm afraid that any thing
        that I might say would come across as "Microsoft bashing." This isn't just the Google
        PR dept. talking either -- I really want to take the high road. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sorry that I can't be of more help. Good luck with your story. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Joe 
    </p>
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
        The funny part is that <strong>talking to the media has absolutely no upside</strong> for
        me.&#160;If I had something important to say, I would much rather post it here on
        my blog and let people link to it and forward it around if they find it interesting.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reasons to blog over talking to a reporter:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>My voice gets through unfiltered</strong>.&#160; No matter how hard they try,
            I've seen reporters misinterpret what I and others have said again and again.&#160;
            I'm sure most of them think that they are faithfully transmitting the meaning of the
            primary source, but they invariably change the meaning along the way -- in some small
            (or large) way.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>I want the link traffic</strong>.&#160; Flow is the currency of the blogging
            world.&#160; Talking to a reporter gets me no flow.&#160; Even when they mention my
            blog (rarely) they almost never link to it.&#160; It seems like they just don't get
            how the web works.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Talking to a reporter could get me fired</strong>.&#160; Google really doesn't
            want me talking to reporters.&#160; Blogging is walking a fine line that requiring
            a healthy dose common sense; but talking to reporters is suicidal.&#160; The problem
            again is that what the reporter writes isn't necessarily what you thought you were
            saying.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>No mountains out of mole hills.<em> </em></strong>Writing something on your
            blog that people find interesting enough to link to and pass around is hard!&#160;
            The real time web (new name for the blog-o-sphere) is a very hard filter.&#160; While
            the media can produce its own buzz, it takes real work and something truly interesting
            to make an impact on the much more democratic medium that is the true internet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So -- reporters -- feel free to send me email.&#160; I'll happily respond in a polite
        way.&#160; But don't count on getting any comments out of me that I'm not willing
        to share on my blog.&#160; And I'd much rather put them on my blog in the first place.

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00242.html">High Dynamic Range and the Quality of the Pixel</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Sun, May 8, 2005</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        I wasn't going to upgrade to Photoshop CS2 because I didn't think that I need it.&#160;
        But that was&#160;before I found out about the new support for High Dynamic Range
        (HDR) and 32 bits per&#160;channel floating point support.&#160; Michael Reichmann
        over at The Luminous Landscape has an <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/hdr.shtml">article</a> talking
        about the new "Merge to HDR".&#160; I was going to how current cameras only handle
        6 stops and all (and what a stop is) but Michael does a good job of that in his article.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm excited about this feature because I think that it will enable me to capture images
        that I haven't been able to before.&#160; I've often shot bracketed exposures with
        the thought that I would merge them together by hand later. The results rarely are
        as good as I imagined when I took the image.&#160; For instance, shooting a sunrise
        of a mountain where the top of the mountain is in the sun but the rest is in shadow
        can be very difficult.&#160; Having a tool that approaches this in a more methodical
        way is exciting.&#160; On top of this, I'm excited by the possibilities of this combined
        with panoramic photography.&#160; Wide angle and pano photography has a problem whereby
        you are taking in so much of a scene that you are much more likely to have parts of
        the image be very bright and others be very dark.&#160; One of the skills that I've
        been developing is the ability to pick a scene where I won't run in to these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, as great as the new Photoshop might be, there are other parts of the digital
        photography system that need to catch up.&#160; The first is on the display side.&#160;
        While the data in a photograph might contain lots of dynamic range, today's displays
        can't show it all.&#160; That is going to change over the next couple of years.&#160;
        On the software side, there is plumbing being laid to support 32bpp through the Windows
        desktop and to the video driver.&#160; (The 3D APIs and graphics cards are support
        a lot of this already because it can be useful in 3D rendering).&#160; The displays
        are going to get better also.&#160; Over the next couple of years, expect to see wide
        gamut and HDR screens coming out.&#160; Sunnybrook is one of the companies that has
        been pioneering this <a href="http://www.sunnybrooktech.com/hdr/index.html">LED based
        display technology</a>.&#160; Where&#160;normal LCD or CRT displays can get a contrast
        ratio of 300-400:1, they claim their LED technology can get 60,000:1.&#160; That means
        the bright spots are brighter and the shadows are darker.&#160; I haven't seen one
        of these displays myself, but I'm super excited by the technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other side that needs to improve is on the image capture side.&#160; I have not
        specific knowledge of any plans from any camera manufacturers, but it is obvious that
        the megapixel race is slowing down.&#160; We are reaching the limits of the glass.&#160;
        Another example is the fact that the new prosumer level Nikon SLRs are still only
        6 megapixel.&#160; It is clear that the camera makers are going to compete on more
        than just the <em>number of pixels</em>.&#160; They will start competing on the <em>quality
        of those pixels</em>. This is going to be very exciting.&#160; We are entering a world
        where digital cameras are not just&#160;matching the abilities of film cameras, but
        they are on the verge of surpassing them.&#160; A camera that can capture higher dynamic
        range and a wider gamut?&#160; Sign me up!
    </p>
    <p>
        The big question in my mind is the print making side of the equation.&#160; When I
        print my photos, I usually send them out (<a href="http://www.whcc.com/">WHCC</a>&#160;or <a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com/">WCI</a>)
        to be printed on a Chromira printer.&#160; This is a printer that uses LEDs to expose
        regular photo paper.&#160; This photo paper is then printed traditionally.&#160; The
        gamut of these devices (and that of the ink jet processes) can be larger than current
        displays but is still fairly limited.&#160; The dynamic range of all of these output
        devices is pretty low compared to what can be done with an emissive display device.&#160;
        The bottom line is that the printing technology isn't keeping up with the rest of
        the system.&#160; What does this mean in the long term?&#160; I'm not sure but we
        will start to see a vast divergence between the quality of an image when displayed
        on a good monitor compared to they quality of an image when printed.
    </p>
    <p>
        It certainly is an exciting time for photography...

        How hard can it be to get this pass?&#160;&#160;The <a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/parking/parkingrpz.htm">website</a>&#160;says
        "to have an application mailed to you, please call (206) 684-5086."
    </p>
    <p>
        The response at that number: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is
        full"<br />
        Two days later: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is full."

        So Rachel decides that this isn't working and goes downtown, parks (no easy task)
        and treks up to the 37th floor of the Seattle Municipal Tower.&#160; Let me set the
        scene for you.&#160; There are two workers helping citizens with their Traffic Permit
        needs.&#160; There is a third that gets up to help Rachel.&#160; Then there is a rotund
        woman sitting next to a ringing phone.&#160; I wasn't there but I imagine that she
        had an unpleasant look on her face.&#160; Let's call her Bertha.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"I'd like to get my zone parking permit"<br />
        <em>Helpful Dude:</em> "Great!&#160; Do you have your forms filled out and your check
        ready?"<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "No.&#160; I tried calling to get the form but the voice mailbox
        was full."<br />
        <em>Bertha (who chimes in from her chair next to a ringing phone):</em> "Well it isn't
        full now."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "I called twice and it was full both times."<br />
        <em>Bertha: </em>"I just emptied it.&#160; It wouldn't be full if you people didn't
        call so much."<br />
        <em>Rachel: </em>"The website instructed me to call.&#160; Why don't you guys just
        put a PDF of the form on the website so that people don't have to call?"<br />
        <em>Guy in next line: </em>"That sounds like a great idea!"<br />
        <em>Bertha:</em> "Nah, that would never work.&#160; People wouldn't know how to download
        it or they would screw it up and it would just create more work for us."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"All right then.&#160; I'll just get my pass and be on my way.&#160;
        I see that I've done all that I can do here."

        Seriously folks, I can't make this stuff up.

        The <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/04/14.html#a238">20% BoF session
        at CFP</a> last night was fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most interesting thing for me was the questions about how 20% time works.&#160;
        Hopefully I can repeat some of them and the answers here.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How will this scale as Google gets bigger? </strong>I don't know.&#160; What
        I've seen of Google management is that they are committed to keeping the same atmosphere
        as the company grows.&#160; As problems crop up (and I'm sure they will) I'm sure
        that Google will look for "non-traditional" solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you track this?&#160; What if someone is spending 30% of their time
        on a side project? </strong>There isn't really official tracking of this sort of thing.&#160;
        It really comes down to trust of the employee.&#160; At the end of the day (or year)
        you have to list what you've accomplished for your review.&#160; If you've wasted
        your time then you have nothing to talk about on your review.&#160; Keep in mind that
        failures aren't the same as doing nothing -- valuable knowledge is gained.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you make sure that people are using the time wisely?&#160; How does
        this relate to the goals of the division/group/etc?</strong> Well -- that is just
        it -- you don't know if the time is being used wisely.&#160; You want the engineer
        to do what <em>he/she</em> thinks is the next big thing, not what management thinks.&#160;
        Most people want to do the next cool think that will fire people up both inside and
        outside the company and may end up making Google money.&#160; If you think that the
        best way for you to add value with your 20% time is to slack off and do nothing than
        that really speaks for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What is the goal for this?&#160; Isn't this just a morale booster? </strong>For
        some people I'm sure that this is just a morale booster.&#160; My impression, from
        the short time I've been at Google, is that 20% time is more than that.&#160; Most
        people want to add value by doing stuff that is far easier to do inside someplace
        like Google than anywhere else.&#160; My feeling is that I want to use the time wisely
        to add value in new and unexpected ways for the company.&#160; There is a pretty fluid
        path for these projects, if they show promise, to get funded with full time engineers.&#160;
        That path is critical if a 20% project ends up being super successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Where do you find 20% to spare? I can't cut 20% of my features or slip my
        project by 20%.</strong>&#160; I think that there is more time then you think.&#160;
        If you do "research"&#160;in&#160; a lightweight way like this perhaps you can take
        the time elsewhere.&#160; Also keep in mind that happy engineers are more productive
        engineers.&#160; And stop going to so many meetings -- and if you do have meetings,
        don't allow people to sit in the back and read their email.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What about using 20% time as a reward for exceptional performers?&#160; What
        about&#160;taking away&#160;20% time for&#160;those who don't use it wisely? </strong>I'm
        not a huge fan of these ideas for a couple of reasons.&#160; First, some of the best
        ideas come from people who are looking at something with fresh eyes.&#160; If we make
        it a reward it may be too late to capture that.&#160; As for punishing people, I would
        think that this would have a chilling affect.&#160; We want people to try wacky things
        that no one else has thought of.&#160; Having some missteps is bound to happen and
        we don't want&#160;people to be afraid to experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why 20%?&#160; Why not 50%? or 10%? </strong>I'm not sure.&#160; My guess
        is that either someone took it out of thin air or some math PhD at Google has a proof
        somewhere.&#160; If anyone reads this and knows I'd love to here the answer.
    </p>

        <strong>How do you allocate the time?&#160; Is it one day a week?&#160; 1.6 hours
        a day? 2 weeks a year and a weekend a month? </strong>From what I've seen so far,
        it is up to the engineer to figure this out.&#160; People can save it up and use it
        a month at a time if they like.&#160; My personal strategy is to spend some a week
        or two really getting some momentum behind something and then switching to a more
        integrated schedule.&#160; As project hit shipping mode and such these things may
        take a back seat while the time accrues.&#160; Keep in mind that no one is watching
        over your shoulder with a stopwatch.<br />

        One thing that I want to emphasize (and it came up multiple times last night) is that
        a lot of this comes down to <strong>trust</strong>.&#160; One of the big parts of
        the secret sauce here is that Google really trusts its&#160;engineers and, from what
        I've seen, the engineers live up to those expectations.
