        <h2><a href="/post/old/00218.html">Chicago Marathon</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Tue, Oct 12, 2004</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        I spent the last weekend in Chicago visiting my parents and my sister's family and
        her three adorable kids.&#160; (Hi Harper, Ellie and Tate!)
    </p>
    <p>
        We combined this trip with my wife&#160;Rachel's first marathon!&#160; We took the
        train downtown early on Sunday morning and got there in plenty of time for the start.&#160;
        It was a complete mob scene.&#160; There were 40,000 people signed up to run the marathon.&#160;
        It took Rachel 15 minutes or so to actually get to the start line.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I cut across the course and was able to see her run by at the halfway mark.&#160;
        I then took my time walking to the finish line so that I could try to catch a glimpse
        of her on the home stretch.&#160; I missed her there but was able to meet up with
        her in the park outside the finish.&#160; Right after she finished she collapsed on
        me and said that it was the hardest thing she ever did and also the best.&#160; That
        is something coming from someone who finished a medical internship.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm so proud of her running it!&#160; Now all she has to do is let her feet heal.&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        Interesting stuff:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everyone is timed with what is called a "champion chip."&#160; This is a little device
            that you tie on to your shoe that marks when you step on checkpoints along the course.&#160;
            They had 10 of these checkpoints total.&#160; I'm not sure what technology they use,
            but it seems to work pretty well.&#160; There would be no way to get an accurate time
            for 40k people without something like this.</li>
        <li>
            Right after Rachel finished someone in front of her called for a medic.&#160; A woman
            and her father had apparently just finished together when he collapsed on the ground.&#160;
            He was still talking but obviously dizzy and confused.&#160; Rachel introduced herself
            as a doctor and volunteered to help.&#160;&#160;She checked his pulse on his wrist
            and in his neck.&#160; If you have a pulse in your wrist, your blood pressure is at
            least 90.&#160; If it is in your neck it is at least 60.&#160; Since the man had a
            pulse in his neck but not in his wrist he had a blood pressure under 90.&#160; She
            sat with them until the medics arrived and he was wheeled away.&#160; We both hope
            everything is okay!</li>
        <li>
            There is a company that tries to take pictures of everyone.&#160; Apparently they
            just shoot away and try to sort it all out later.&#160; Last night when we checked
            the site they had finished going through 22% of the photos they had taken and had
            three pictures of Rachel online.&#160; I can't imagine dealing with that many pictures!&#160;
            I'm wondering if they have some sort&#160;of OCR system to read the bib numbers off
            the runners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I took some pictures but I haven't had a chance to sort through them yet.&#160; Hopefully
        I can put one or two up in the next couple of days.

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00217.html">Adobe DNG image format</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Mon, Sep 27, 2004</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        Adobe announced today a new image format for storing raw camera data.&#160; Dubbed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/main.html">DNG</a>&#160;(for
        Digital Negative) this format is meant to be a common interchange for the fast proliferating
        collection of proprietary raw image formats.&#160; By some estimates there are over
        60 different raw image formats out there.&#160; Because of this, there are really
        only a couple of software vendors that can afford to get into the raw image processing
        game.&#160; It appears that Adobe hopes to level this playing field with this new
        specification. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand the significance of this, it is important that you understand how raw
        image formats work and why they are different.&#160; When most modern cameras (not
        using the <a href="http://www.foveon.com/X3_tech.html">Foveon</a> sensor) advertise
        take a picture, they have a grid of sensors.&#160; These sensors only measure intensity
        but not color.&#160; To capture color data, a color filter (called a Bayer filter)
        is placed over the sensor so that each little sensor only sees one color (typically
        Red, Green and Blue).&#160; That means that the camera only knows one color value
        at each pixel.&#160; This raw data is then processed using a set of complex algorithms
        to produce an image that has all the color information for each pixel.&#160; For each
        pixel in the raw data, these algorithms reconstruct the missing color data by looking
        at the surrounding pixels and <em>guessing</em>.&#160; Because of this guessing, there
        are multiple ways to process this raw data -- and there is the possibility that these
        algorithms and guessing will get better in the future.&#160; Because of this, all
        serious cameras offer a raw mode where the raw (or close to it) sensor data is saved
        in a special format and the complex demosaicing algorithms can be done later on a
        computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, raw images are fundamentally different from regular images in that they store
        raw sensor data before it has been processed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The rub comes with the fact that each camera manufacturer has a proprietary raw format
        (or two or three) and some generally crappy software for dealing with it.&#160; Companies
        like Adobe (with the Adobe Camera Raw plugin for photoshop) and Capture One have been
        waging a guerilla war to create products to read all of these formats.&#160; If Adobe
        can succeed in getting camera manufacturers to implement this format in their cameras,
        life for many photographers could become much much easier.&#160; But this isn't a
        sure thing.&#160; Camera manufacturers are very aware of the business benefits of
        lock in.&#160; They do it with lens mounts and with their software suites.&#160; Canon
        or Nikon may see their proprietary formats as an advantage in the marketplace.&#160;
        Nikon even charges for the software to convert its raw format while Canon and most
        other manufacturers provide it for free. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't gotten a read from my buddies in Microsoft imaging, but I'm hoping that
        DNG is a huge success.&#160; Assuming that Adobe doesn't try to assert its own proprietary
        control over the format (Postscript anyone?) it may just let the camera manufacturers
        concentrate on making cameras and leave the software development up to a third party
        marketplace. 
    </p>
    <p>
        [update: RichB points out that there is also an open source utility for dealing with
        raw camera data called <a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">DCRaw</a> and
        built by Dave Coffin. Apparently Photoshop (and Capture One?) build on some of Dave's
        work.]

        <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> and I hung out tonight and went
        to dinner together.&#160; We started out from my house in Montlake and walked through
        the university to Aladdin Gyro's up north of 45th on the Ave.&#160; We were going
        to go to Thai Tom but the line was too long. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We talked about Google, Microsoft and the industry as a whole.&#160; Tip jars, Bush
        and how I should never expect to get social security (I already knew this).&#160;
        He's a good guy who likes to shake things up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since everyone wanted to see me wearing my Noogler hat, I had him snap a quick picture
        with my new Canon 20D.&#160; I also grabbed a picture of him. We are both looking
        a little worse for wear from the long walk up there and back.

        If you really want to chew up some of my bandwidth (I may have to take this down)
        you can grab the original files (~2MB each) of <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/NooglerHat-orig.jpg">me</a> and <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/DaveWiner-orig.jpg">Dave</a>.&#160;
        These are jpgs right out the camera.&#160; Be warned that they are shot in the AdobeRGB
        color space so you should really view them in a color space aware application (something
        more like Photoshop and not IE).

        [Update:&#160; <a href="http://www.freeke.org/ffg">Dave Walker</a> suggested I check

        Taking a break from inadvertently feeding the rumor mill, I'd like to point to the
        announcement for the new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0409/04092104canoneos1dsmkii.asp">Canon
        1Ds Mark II</a>.&#160; This thing looks awesome!&#160; Features that stand out: 16.7
        MP full frame, fast startup time and a wireless transfer option.&#160; There is still
        a question if they improved the battery technology or not.&#160; Not bad for a&#160;mere
        $8k.&#160; The thing still looks super big and heavy.

        I would love to own one of these, but I can't see my self spending that much on what
        is really a hobby.&#160; Plus, in the spirit of sour grapes, it would probably be
        too heavy.&#160; I really can't complain because I just received&#160;the Canon 20D
        that I preordered a little while ago.&#160; Now I have to find the time to go out
        and shoot.

        They call new Google employees Nooglers.&#160; That was what I was last week when
        I was down in Mountain View.&#160; It was a pretty exciting week.&#160; I went to
        some training classes and got my computers set up and such.&#160; I spent quite a
        bit of time working and hanging out with other Googlers.&#160; Everyone was super
        smart and down to earth.&#160; I learned a lot and had a great time.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the week I got my Noogler hat (propeller on top, of course) at a company
        wide friday event.&#160; I've been digging in this week back in Seattle.&#160; I'm
        hoping that I can get my first checkin in by thursday.&#160; My only job now is to
        write code and ship product.&#160; That is about all I can say too :)

        I met with HR yesterday afternoon to turn in my batch and my corporate AmEx card.&#160;
        It felt like a cheesy cop show:&#160; "Gimme your badge and your gun, Mahoney -- you're
        suspended!"&#160; Right after that I went back to my building and had a buddy sign
        me in as a visitor so that we could all hang out and play some xbox.&#160; It&#160;was
        hard to let go and not get involved in the discussions going on in the hallways.&#160;
        The day before a large group of us went out for my goodbye lunch.&#160; It felt a
        little bit like a funeral in its finality.&#160;

        First off, I'd like to say that everyone has been really good about my leaving --

        Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2k3 and Windows XP SP2.&#160; I've been
        working with a great group of people on Avalon and Longhorn for the past couple of
        years.&#160; It is really hard to say goodbye to so many friends and such a great
        group.&#160; But I feel that it is time to move on to new challenges.

        I'm going to be going to go work for Google.&#160; It looks like I'll be staying in
        the Seattle area for now.&#160; Don't ask me what I'll be doing because I honestly
        don't know.&#160; I'm going to be working with a good group of guys that I've worked
        with before.&#160; I trust that they are working on interesting technology.&#160;
        Hopefully we'll be able to make a splash at some point.&#160; Chances are that I won't
        be able to talk about it here for quite a while though.

        The decision to leave Microsoft has been a very difficult one.&#160; I still believe
        in the Avalon vision and plan.&#160; I'm more excited than ever about the technology.&#160;
        Even though I knew that I was going to leave a couple of weeks ago, I meant everything
        that I've posted and said.&#160; You can be sure that my excitement over the recent
        changes to the Longhorn and Avalon ship plans <em>aren't</em> the company line.&#160;
        If I disagreed I would have said so.&#160; What are they going to do, fire me?&#160;
        In some ways I feel like I've made my impact on the Avalon project.&#160; I've been
        there since the start and helped shape what it is today.&#160; There is a lot of work
        to do yet, but the broad strokes are in place.&#160; Now I'm just like most of you
        reading this: I'm going to be a user of the Avalon technology instead of one of the
        guys developing it.&#160; I wish those losers would get off their butts and ship already
        :)

        It has been an exciting month and a half or so.&#160; I sat down for coffee with a
        coworker who is working for Google sometime in late July.&#160; We chatted and he
        told me about the way that Google works and how much fun he was having there.&#160;
        The thing that really attracted me was the fact that it was just a smaller company
        with smaller groups.&#160; After working on such large projects for so long, I was
        really ready to try something on a smaller scale.&#160; Plus, I've been working for
        MS for my entire professional life and I'm going to have to diversify at some point.&#160;
        Anyway, I got a resume to him and flew down to Mountain View for an interview.&#160;
        Things went well and I accepted&#160;the offer last week.&#160; As a point of reference,
        I didn't find out about the Longhorn schedule shake up until a few weeks after I started
        the whole process.

        What does this mean for my blog?&#160; Nothing really.&#160; I'm still going to talk
        Avalon -- I just won't have the inside line anymore.&#160; My knowledge will probably
        go stale in the next month or so.&#160; Eventually I hope to talk about Google stuff,
        but I'm going to have to feel out where the lines are.&#160; 
    </p>

        Wish me luck!

        Rachel and I went to a reading from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312324839/qid=1094054140/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-5121671-1377764?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">"On
        Call: A Doctor's Days and Nights in Residency" by Emily Transue</a> last night.&#160;
        Emily is a friend of ours and was my wife Rachel's chief resident when she started
        residency.&#160; I haven't had a chance to read the book yet (we picked up a copy
        last night) but, from the excerpts that Emily read aloud, it sounds great.&#160; If
        you don't know someone who's been through residency (or even if you do!) this book
        will give you an understanding of the ups and downs -- both emotionally and physically
        -- that a doctor goes through during residency.&#160; I saw it up close and personal
        while Rachel was going through it.

        Trivia: That picture on the cover isn't her.&#160; But the coat is hers.&#160; She
        had to send it to New York for a couple of weeks to be photographed.&#160; She <em>does</em> have
        a picture on the inside of the sleeve.
