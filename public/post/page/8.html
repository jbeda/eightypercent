    <p>
        I've polished up my pano building tool so that it now works with large 16 bit panoramas.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        To recap from <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/25.html">last
        episode</a>:&#160; <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm">PTAssembler</a> and <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/pano12ml.htm">PanoTools</a> are <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/digital-panoramas.shtml">really
        cool</a>&#160;but there are some bugs in PanoTools that prevent it from working with
        really large images or 16 bit images.&#160; The first is that PanoTools outputs tiff
        images that use packbits compression.&#160; For some reason Photoshop chokes when
        loading these files.&#160; The second issue is that PanoTools doesn't know how to
        create 16 bit photoshop files with layers as photoshop didn't <em>do</em> 16 bit layers
        when it was written.&#160; I've worked around this with my latest version of PanoTiffToPSD. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It does the following: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Optionally uses libtiff to reencode a set of tiff&#160;images with no compression.&#160;
            To save disk space, you can choose to overwrite the original images or do the conversion
            and leave the original images alone.&#160; The converted version will be deleted after
            being used by photoshop. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Loads up&#160;each of the tiff files and drives Photoshop (via IDispatch COM interfaces
            for you dorks out there) to load up each file and move it to a layer in a new image. 
        </li>
    </ol>

        I'm trying out putting some Google Ads on my web page.&#160; Mostly this is an experiment
        but I wouldn't mind something to offset the (pretty low already) cost of hosting this
        site.&#160; It looks like the first batch of ads are all about seattle driving school
        and legal help.&#160; Apparently my entry on traffic court in Seattle is what the
        ad algorithm keyed in on.

        I'd love to buy <em>that</em> camera.&#160; I'm torn as to upgrade my D60 to the 20D.

    <p>
        This morning I spend a couple of hours hanging out in the Redmond courthouse to contest
        a speeding ticket.&#160; I didn't get my act together enough to file for discovery
        so I couldn't put together a real defense.&#160; There appear to be two easy ways
        to beat a ticket around here.&#160; First the infraction might not have been filed
        on time.&#160; Second, your trail might not be speedy enough -- two months after the
        infraction, I think.&#160; Neither of these applied to me so I ended up getting a
        deferred finding (a sort of probation). 
    </p>
    <p>
        While I probably could have done this via mail, it was enlightening to watch how things
        work.&#160; First, your trial doesn't get scheduled really.&#160; You are grouped
        with all of the other cases to be covered that morning.&#160; You sit there from the
        beginning of the session until your name comes up.&#160; The judge presiding this
        morning worked it such that the actual lawyers got to go first and the rest of us
        schmoes representing ourselves go after that.&#160; It was interesting to see how
        much time it really took the lawyers to beat a case.&#160; It mostly was about finding
        a loophole and arguing it.&#160; The judge has some discretion as to how to interpret
        things but most of it is cut and dried.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The thing that really surprised me was that by the time my case came up there were
        no lawyers in the room.&#160; This included the prosecutor.&#160; I think it really
        sucks that you can be tried for an infraction without a prosecuting attorney even
        present.&#160; To me it is a slap in the face that the state wants to extort money
        out of me (via the traffic ticket) without even bothering to have somebody there to
        personally do the extorting.&#160; At least the mafia comes and collects in person.&#160;
        Apparently this has been fought over and gone to the Supreme Bourt (at least that
        is what the judge said)&#160;but I don't have the time to really dig in to it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, I would urge everyone to contest a ticket just once to see how it all
        works.&#160; Or just show up in Redmond courthouse courtroom two any morning and sit
        and watch.
