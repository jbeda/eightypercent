        A couple of buddies of mine (Avi and Ken) both have <a href="http://www.lomography.com/about/">Lomo
        cameras</a> that they shoot with.&#160; For the uninitiated, these are super low tech
        cameras that are mass produced in Russia.&#160; There is no autofocus but instead
        a choice of 4 (count 'em -- four) focus settings.&#160; These cameras are so simple
        and bulletproof, that using them is more of a philosophy than a tool.&#160; The whole
        idea is to experiment and play.&#160; On top of that, the lens isn't sharp corner
        to corner and it has quite a bit if vignetting.&#160; That's okay -- it adds to the
        Lomo look.&#160; If I still shot film, I would pick one of these up right away.&#160;
        I may pick one up anyway.&#160; In essence, these cameras are the anti-digital camera. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you aren't willing to go that far, there is the <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/">lensbaby</a>.&#160;
        I have one of these on order.&#160; This is a super simple lens for you SLR.&#160;
        It is a single lens attached to some flexible tubing.&#160; You focus by using your
        fingertips to move the lens in and out.&#160; You can also tilt the focus plane.&#160;
        This lens also has quite a bit of blur and vignetting.&#160; And it works on digital
        SLRs?&#160; This thing is so old school that you have to manually take it apart to
        change the aperture.&#160; Sure, you could get the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 lens cheaper
        -- and it has autofocus and an adjustable apature.&#160; But there is something cool
        about the look and feel of the images form this lens.&#160; Check out some of the
        photos <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/pages/gall_strong.php">here</a>.&#160; (I
        want to post photos but I don't want to steal anybody's images.)

        <span class="lead">Thu, Jul 8, 2004</span>
        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        I recently went to New Zealand.&#160; Since it is an outdoorsy type of place I put
        my camelback water bladder/backpack in my big duffle bag and had a great time.&#160;
        Since I'm a responsible hiker, I have a standard emergency kit in my backpack that
        contains things like a compass, foil space blanket, ace bandage, banana powerbars
        (these are so gross I'll only eat them in an emergency), etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Cut to me&#160;going on a hike last Monday and grab my trusty back with the kit already
        put together.&#160; I wanted to put something in my emergency pack and noticed a slip
        of paper from the TSA informing me that they had confiscated my pack of 25 windproof
        matches.&#160; If I had a scanner I would post an image of&#160;the notice.&#160;
        The rule apparently is that knives must go in your checked baggage and matches must
        be in your carryon baggage.&#160; Don't ask me to explain this.&#160; Also don't ask
        me to explain why I can't use my PocketPC to read books during takeoff and landing.&#160;
        These things cannot be explained. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, imagine that I had gotten lost in the mountains last Monday and it started to
        get cold.&#160; Normal people would have dispaired and rolled over and died.&#160;
        But not me!&#160; I was a boy scout and was prepared ("Be prepared, its the motto
        of the Boy Scouts!").&#160; I'd reach in to my emergency kit to get my matches to
        start a fire.&#160; Instead of finding life saving matches I would instead find a
        very official looking notice from the TSA letting me know that I'm screwed.

        <div class="post">
          

    <p>
        <strong>Update: </strong>8/29/04 -- There is an updated version of this tool described <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/08/28.html#a207">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've been a regular reader, you know that I've been <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/25.html#a188">having
        a blast</a> <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/14.html#a189">playing </a>with
        making digital panoramas.&#160; The problem that I've been hitting is twofold: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            When I want to use <a href="http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mihal/enblend/">enblend</a> to
            do the blending, I don't get the component layers in photoshop.&#160; I get a flat
            blended tiff file that usually looks great.&#160; However, if I want to tweak it I
            have to manually find the tiff file and&#160;import that to a layer so that I can
            paint the original over the endblended result. 
        </li>
        <li>
            PanoTools can work with 16bit files just fine but it doesn't know how to create a
            Photoshop PSD file.&#160; (16 bit layers were only added in Photoshop CS. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Both of these require the fairly manual process of loading up a bunch of tif files
        and copying them in to one composite file with masks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a dork, I wrote a program to automate this from the outside.&#160; This is a
        command line utility that drives photoshop from the outside.&#160; It would be cool
        if this were a plugin that would go in the "Automate" menu but I didn't have time
        to figure that out. It just grabs a bunch of files, opens them up one by one and puts
        them in to a new PS&#160;file.&#160; &#160;This works well with the individual .tif
        files that PanoTools creates.&#160; If you have feature suggestions let me know and
        I'll see what I can do. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, here is the <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/PanoTiffToPSD/PanoTiffToPSD-exe-1.0.zip">binary</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/PanoTiffToPSD/PanoTiffToPSD-src-1.0.zip">source</a> and <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/PanoTiffToPSD/License.txt">license</a>.&#160;
        Please be aware that this requires the version 1.1 .Net runtime.&#160; You can get
        this from <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com">windows update</a> if you don't already.&#160; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/technologyinfo/howtoget/default.aspx">Here</a> is
        more info on getting the runtime. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Interesting notes on programming to Photoshop: 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways to automate photoshop (that I've found).&#160; The first is using
        "Actions".&#160; This is the built in way to record a bunch of steps and replay them.&#160;
        There is a bunch of UI for this and it is good for simple things.&#160; Actions are
        to limiting for this problem&#160;as anything that iterates over multiple files or
        has "if" statements is super hard to do with Actions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The second way to program is via a set of COM interfaces.&#160; Adobe installs a type
        library that provides some nice object model to do quite a few things.&#160; My understanding
        is that this is exposed via a built in javascript engine and via applescript on Macs.&#160;
        Since COM is language neutral, you can drive it (for example) via the scripting host
        (JavaScript, VBScript), &#160;<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">perl</a>,
        VB or C#.&#160; I choose to use C#. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The programmable interface has some pretty glaring holes in its support.&#160; For
        example, you can't do anything with the tools such as the magic wand.&#160; There
        is also no easy programmatic access to creation of layer masks.&#160; You can get
        around this by installing a plugin called the "ScriptListener."&#160; This essentially
        creates funky unreadable code that (I'm thinking) uses the same hooks as the Actions
        code.&#160; On windows this is written out as VB or JavaScript.&#160; Here is an example
        from "c:\ScriptingListenerJS.log" to create a layer mask on the current layer. 
    </p>
    <pre>// =======================================================
var id375 = charIDToTypeID( "Mk  " );
    var desc84 = new ActionDescriptor();
    var id376 = charIDToTypeID( "Nw  " );
    var id377 = charIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    desc84.putClass( id376, id377 );
    var id378 = charIDToTypeID( "At  " );
        var ref66 = new ActionReference();
        var id379 = charIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
        var id380 = charIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
        var id381 = charIDToTypeID( "Msk " );
        ref66.putEnumerated( id379, id380, id381 );
    desc84.putReference( id378, ref66 );
    var id382 = charIDToTypeID( "Usng" );
    var id383 = charIDToTypeID( "UsrM" );
    var id384 = charIDToTypeID( "RvlA" );
    desc84.putEnumerated( id382, id383, id384 );
executeAction( id375, desc84, DialogModes.NO );</pre>
    <p>
        As you can see, this isn't the easiest code to read. The solution is to wrap it in
        functions that you can call at will. Here is how I created a C# function out of this: 
    </p>
    <pre>void CreateLayerMask()
{
    int id375 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Mk  " );
    PS.ActionDescriptor desc84 = new PS.ActionDescriptor();
    int id376 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Nw  " );
    int id377 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    desc84.PutClass( id376, id377 );
    int id378 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "At  " );
    PS.ActionReference ref66 = new PS.ActionReference();
    int id379 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    int id380 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    int id381 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Msk " );
    ref66.PutEnumerated( id379, id380, id381 );
    desc84.PutReference( id378, ref66 );
    int id382 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Usng" );
    int id383 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "UsrM" );
    int id384 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "RvlA" );
    desc84.PutEnumerated( id382, id383, id384 );
    app.ExecuteAction( id375, desc84, PS.PsDialogModes.psDisplayNoDialogs );
}</pre>
    <p>
        This is a little bit of a pain but at least you can get stuff done.&#160; It would
        be cool if we could build a library of these things.&#160; If anyone else is interested
        in driving photoshop let me know and I'll help bring this stuff together.

    </p>
    <p>
        He works on writing games for <a href="http://www.midway.com/">Midway</a> and has

            Add-ins for other packages.&#160; If those packages are DLL based, you can always
            use MC++ to write add-ins.&#160; With both WinForms (I think) and Avalon, you should
            be able to write UI that can be hosted via hwnds.&#160; If the package is COM based,
            you can either use MC++ or CLR COM interop support.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing a new tool. You shouldn't have to start from scratch.&#160; You can host windows
            that are written in unmanaged code in both WinForms and Avalon.&#160; Beyond this,
            you can manage internal intefaces via P/Invoke, COM interop or MC++ (if you aren't
            happy with the current managed C++ implementation, all I can say is that the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/slippman/archive/2004/05/28/143886.aspx">team
            has heard you</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/whidbey/">changes</a> are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hsutter/">in
            the works</a>). 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The next question: Is it worth it?&#160; We definately hope so, but there is nothing
        stopping you from continuing to use the technologies that you are currently using.&#160;
        Managed code and garbage collection aren't the solution to every problem.&#160; There
        are certainly places where it does make sense to drop down in to unmanaged code, just
        like there are places where it make sense to drop down in to assembly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, if you do decide to jump, will it do everything that you want?&#160; Vince gives
        an example where he can't get a specific behavior out of WinForms without dropping
        down and P/Invoking.&#160; I'm not sure what is going on here, but the reality is
        that there are going to be things that we don't wrap or don't think of.&#160; That
        is just the challenge of writing a platform -- we try to expose as much functionality
        as possible in as easy to program a way as possible while leaving as much room for
        extensibility as possible.&#160; This is a complicated equation and we are sure to
        miss stuff.&#160; To complicate things, when we move forward with something that is
        more than just evolutionary (WinForms and Avalon, for example) there are going to
        be regressions in functionality.&#160; We may have decided to change the equation
        from one framework to another.&#160; All I can really say is that we try our best
        and please let us know if there is something we missed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, Vince looks at my 3 reasons to write rich client apps: presentation, local storage
        and network connectivity.&#160; How important these are to different developers and
        users depends on specific circumstances.&#160; While local storage may not be that
        big a deal for networking, it would be huge for an online image gallery application
        with a smart client interface (it looks like the guys at <a href="http://www.ngallery.org">nGallery</a> are
        eventually headed in this direction).&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        One area where the web model has been ahead of the traditional Windows APIs is the
        ease of connecting to the network.&#160; But it was the case where there were things
        you could do with Win32 (raw network access) that you can't do with a typical browser
        and there are things that you can do with the browser (talk http to load and display
        an image asynchronously) that are super hard in Win32.&#160; Making the smart client
        better is all about removing these "either-or" choices and giving you the best of
        both worlds. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, Steve rails on the fact that it looks like MSBuild isn't going to support
        VC++ out of the box.&#160; I have no clue what is going on here but stay tuned to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/akipman/">AKipman's
        blog</a> for news. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I really think that this is a healty debate and I thank Joel for getting
        it started.&#160; Hopefully this gives everyone a little insight in to why we are
        doing what we are doing in Avalon and Longhorn.

        in</a> on the action too. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Go ahead and read them if you haven't already and then come back. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is my summary so that Jon, Joel and everyone else can make sure that I'm reading
        them right. First, Jon is asking why anyone (and the "enterprise" specifically) would
        want to write a rich client (probably for any platform) above and beyond a web application.
        Joel takes this and runs with it -- saying essentially that the rich client is dead
        and that the Windows API is dying with a whimper. He also says that there are two
        camps of developers inside of Windows: those that want to keep on the same track and
        those who are for all the new technologies. 
    </p>
    <h4>IE history 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Being on the Windows team, and Avalon specifically, my job is to help write a product
        that is compelling enough to overcome the very valid concerns that these guys have.
        I started out on the IE team (now you know where at least a little bit of the IE team
        went, Joel) back in 1997 -- toward the tail end of IE4 development. I firmly believe
        that we had the better product starting with IE4 and we really turned up the heat
        with IE5. IE was, in a lot of ways, a rear guard action against Netscape. Netscape
        was trying to replace the Windows API with a cross platform "Netscape" API. 
    </p>
    <p>
        IE was, buy many metrics, very successful. First, we gained significant adoption.
        I personally think that this was mostly due to a superior product. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, we also, by making the browser market a 2 horse race, drove baseline interoperability
        in the web space. Where would the world be without IE? Do you think that we would
        have an interoperable browser space now? Based on pure psychic reasoning, my guess
        is that without the healthy competition from MS, Netscape would have owned the client
        space completely. At this point I don't think that <i>anyone</i> owns the web client
        platform. Despite IE's market share, the network addressable platform pieces that
        anyone uses are largely restricted to the W3C blessed parts. So, taking a look at
        the IE4 and IE5 timeframe, in some ways you can thank Microsoft for enabling a mostly
        standards based web by making the browser a two horse race. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Where IE wasn't successful was in bringing the Web model in as a fundamental part
        of the Windows API. Sure, you had the reusable browser control and the Trident (mshtml.dll)
        engine. But you were either writing a web-like application (HTAs included) or you
        were writing a Win32 application. There were certain things that were easy to do with
        traditional Win32 that you couldn't do with IE and things that you could do easily
        with IE that you couldn't do with Win32. 
    </p>
    <h4>The best of windows and the best of the web 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Avalon, and Longhorn in general, is our attempt to reenergize the rich client at Microsoft.
        Is it, as Joel says, too late? I don't think so. I think that the combination of features
        we are putting together will be compelling enough to start turning the tide. Are we
        ever going to see a world where the web is history and all development is focused
        on writing Longhorn applications? Of course not. Longhorn is a long term investment
        to start laying the ground work for a rich client that takes advantage of the web
        in a way that we have never been able to before. This is what we mean when we say
        that we want to make Avalon the best of Windows and the best of the Web. We want to
        take some of the advantages of the web and build them in to the windows API. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do people write web based client/server apps over writing rich client apps for
        Windows? 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Frictionless deployment story 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cross platform interoperability 
        </li>
        <li>
            More fun to code -- you can set up your own API system and abstract HTML to a large
            extent 
        </li>
        <li>
            Built in network/server awareness 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You put all of these together and you have a pretty darn compelling story for many
        scenarios. How can the Windows client compete with this? The key is to take the good
        things of the web that we can (1, 3 and 4) and combine that with all of the goodness
        from having stuff run on the client. Don't get me wrong -- I still believe in the
        web as a way to interoperate and exchange content and as a lowest common denominator
        for UI interaction. But we can do so much better than HTML with the horsepower that
        is sitting on our desk when it makes sense to do so. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, Joel says that he can "install" GMail by hitting Ctrl-D, gmail, Ctrl-Enter.
        My understanding (and I haven't had time to really play with GMail yet) is that Google
        has written browser specific code to enhance the user experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With Avalon you should be able to implement a GMail like application that takes advantage
        of the rich client in some very significant ways: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Rich user experience</b>.&#160; No page refreshes on simple actions.&#160; Smooth
            animation and graphical composition.&#160; The ability to do rich real time data visualization. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Local Storage</b>. Cache the mail data locally for faster access and more integration
            with other desktop services.&#160; You could also support reading and responding to
            mail while offline. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Easy network connectivity</b>.&#160; Using web services, the ability to use widely
            interoperable protocols to talk with a server. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Will this be possible in Longhorn? YES. This is the direction that we want to go and
        what I mean when I say "network connected rich client applications." We aren't replacing
        the web or the web paradigm. We are instead providing the platform so that it is easy
        -- and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">worthwhile</i> -- for developers to
        differentiate when their applications are running on Windows. 
    </p>
    <h4>But what about the enterprise? 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Now, to get to some specific points brought up in the articles. Jon brings up some
        good points around the enterprise space. I can only say that we are working hard to
        build a package of features on the client that will either make enterprise developers
        willing to standardize on Longhorn or take the extra cost to provide a rich client
        solution in addition to a web based solution. There are some applications where this
        will never make sense. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there are a set of applications that are currently being implemented on against
        today's web clients that could be vastly improved by rich client capabilities. I can
        definitely see a need for a rich expense reporting application with a good offline
        mode and rich display and reporting. Anything that involves charting or graphing can
        also be enhanced by using some rich client technologies. I use Outlook every day to
        do email. There is a web solution for Exchange called "Outlook Web Access" (OWA) that
        uses DHTML and all of the other web goodies to provide as good an experience as possible
        through the web client. While I think that OWA is great and I'm a huge fan of what
        those guys are doing, I'd still much rather use the real Outlook. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With Avalon we are hoping to make it vastly easier to write rich data connected applications
        like Outlook. However, we don't want stop there. We also want developers to be able
        to get the best of the web. These applications can run in the browser for the browser
        experience or can be "one click" installed and run on the desktop.&#160; Even when
        they are "installed" they can be managed from the server and be kept up to date as
        easily as copying a new version on to the server. Think of how many enterprise LOB
        apps could benefit from that? Expense reporting (with offline mode), "Digital Dashboard"
        data aggregation and visualization, integrated content creation, new network connected
        collaboration applications and more.&#160; 
    </p>
    <h4>Backward compatibility 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Now, talking to some of Joel's points: He says that we have fundamentally changed
        our view of backward compatibility. I totally disagree. As one Slashdot poster <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=111332&amp;cid=9446923">put
        it</a>: "Joel confuses binary compatibility with API compatibility." From the end
        users point of view we are still completely committed to making apps that run on Windows
        continue to run on Windows. At the PDC, Jim Allchin showed off <s>Lotus 123</s> Visicalc
        running on Longhorn. The developer experience, however, will have a gap -- it is necessary
        as part of the transition to managed code. He states that VB.Net not being source
        compatible with VB6 is a first. I would argue that the switch from 16 bit to 32 bit
        is very similar to the switch from unmanaged code to managed code. Old apps will continue
        to run and new apps are written to the new technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In Avalon we are working very hard to provide rich ways for application developers
        to tie their old code in with new code that takes advantage of our new technologies.
        You can host a Win32 hwnd -- WinForms based or not -- in with Avalon content. You
        can also host Avalon content in a Win32 hwnd. You can nest these completely. While
        it is true that you have to write new code to get the new features -- and that the
        new code is part of a completely new framework -- we don't want to force application
        developers to rewrite everything to start using our stuff. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Above and beyond what Avalon has been doing, the C++ team has heard what the community
        has been saying and is doing some great work in Whidbey to make the managed version
        of C++ better than ever.&#160; It will be the best solution for those who have the
        C++ code and skills and want to start taking advantage of the the CLR. 
    </p>
    <h4>What's a $300B (market cap) company to do? 
    </h4>
    <p>
        The real question is: What are we to do? Without arguing about the fine points, we
        are stuck with a choice. We can either continue adding doodad on top of doodad to
        Win32 (and maintain backward compat from an API and binary perspective) or we can
        try and make a fresh start with WinFX and set ourselves up for the future. Look at
        the timelines: Windows 1.0 with the start of Win16 came out in 1985. Windows 95, with
        the mainstream advent of Win32 came out in 1995. It is now 2004. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now is the time for Microsoft to either watch the Windows rich client sail in to the
        sunset or to do its best to reinvigorate it. The only way to make this happen is to
        go "all-in" and think big. We want to empower developers by making a much richer,
        network connected and modern API for programming on windows. WinFX is all about taking
        what we've learned over the last 20 years and creating a solid platform for the next
        20 years. We will provide the right API, backward compat for old applications and
        a great bridge between the two for developers. If we really want developers to write
        code that only runs on windows, we have to provide features and enticements that they
        can't get anywhere else. While I don't think that it is too late, I do think that
        we have our work cut out for us.
